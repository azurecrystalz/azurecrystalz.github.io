<Narration novel>
While I was in Hungary, I heard him play the piano at a competition.

["Polonaise No. 5 Op. 44 in F-sharp minor."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqOIssmVIBQ) Starting with an aggressive style, it transitions into simple and elegant melodies, only to return again to strong and intense motifs. It’s a common characteristic of Chopin's pieces...

Fredrick’s music was like a wave of sound.

A tidal wave.

Every note was like a snowflake, fragile pearls that seemed to melt away at the simplest touch.
All of them were stunningly symmetrical, but not one of them was the same.

I was mesmerized by the waves of his music, becoming one with the crystals within it.

It surprised me.

How the piano was able to sound like that.
With performances that captivate others not with skill, but instead with the world of sound they create.
I always thought that the better I played, the better it would sound, so it surprised me.

For the second time in my life,
I thought the piano sounded beautiful.

That’s why I accepted the professor’s invitation and went to an unfamiliar university, to hear Fredrick’s music again.

On the day of practice in-person.

My playing resonated within the practice room.
Liszt's transcendental etude “No. 2."

Forgetting the professor’s existence and his suggestions, I became completely immersed in the keys before me.

A flurry of staccato notes danced across the sheet music.
I just played, surrendering my entire body to the piano.

—More speed! More accuracy!

—Imagine even more!

Flawless finger movements, muscles in motion. As my imagination grew more precise, so did my fingers.
Moving my fingers exactly how I imagined them to was one of my talents, according to my mother.

But the professor frowned.

“Having impeccable accuracy isn't the most important thing when playing the piano, Kuguri…”
Even though I heard his words, I continued to play the score.

I didn’t know any other way to play.

While I was eating in the cafeteria, I got a call from my mother.
She insisted that I withdraw from the Chopin Competition held the following year.

*“—It would be shameful if you competed and didn’t win. Practice carefully and aim for victory instead.”*

The competition was only held once every five years, and there’s an age restriction, so I planned to compete the next year.
For a pianist, the Chopin Competition wasn’t something that could be done many times in a lifetime.

But, if my mother said so then I had to.

I told her that I understood before hanging up.

I looked down at my partly finished plate and realized I lost my appetite.
Resting a cheek on my hand, I noticed Fredrick sitting at the back of the cafeteria.

He was on the phone with someone. His gaze softened, and he smiled gently.

He… smiled?

That surprised me a little.

It was the first time I’d seen him with an expression like that.

I’d always assumed that he was alone like me, but I supposed he could have friends too.

Fredrick, what were you thinking about? When you smiled?

While I stared idly, I felt a tap on my shoulder behind me.

Someone firmly leaned their weight against my back.
The warmth of their body made me flinch against my will.

“Woah, not a single piercing in sight. Aren’t you a diligent one, Tadzio?”

When I turned, Solomon's face was close enough for me to feel his breath.
He grinned.

“Your playing sounds dull, without a single flaw.”

Solomon brushed my earlobe. “You’ve got such pristine ears. What would happen if I pierced them? Who do you think would be the one to make the first mark on your body?" he whispered.

Feeling uncomfortable, I stood up.

Solomon sat in the chair where I had just sat and said, "If you ever want an ear piercing, come find me."

“I’ll pierce them for you, pretty boy.”

I hurried out of the cafeteria, ignoring Solomon’s laughter.
