Welcome, Chief, to our “Folly Jolly Paradise”[^1].

All of our furniture has been set up, so feel free to take a look around.

<Bubble mc>
Woah, you even bought a chair for Kinari-kun!

As for how it fits in with the room’s decor… well it’s definitely not the most cohesive, but…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
It’s quite nice, isn’t it, _cicá_?

Wouldn’t this chair be a nice fit for you too?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Nooo, it’d fit Kinari-kun best, since it’s his.

Oh… it’s time for my workout.

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Your workout?

<Bubble mc>
There’s a gym down in the basement.

Muneuji-kun and I have been exercising there lately.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oh? Well, it’s good to work out.

I like pushing my muscles to their limits too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Is that so?

In that case, would you like to go together?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Haha, he’s ignoring me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Aha… ha…

Well, anyone can use it at any time, so feel free to check it out whenever you want!

I’ll be going to my workout now!

<Bubble character="Raito">
Oh, Kuguri. You’re here too?

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
…_Sigh_.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
How about it? Since we’re both here, why don’t we workout togeth–

<Bubble character="Raito">
Ignored again… Well, fine.

I won’t fall behind either.
