<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;―Here is the 5AM update.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;There are 22 contestants remaining.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;Area B-8 is now restricted.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
U… Ugh, so heavy…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Good morning, <i>maci-</i>pie&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Huh?! Wh-What are you laying on me for?!

Get off of me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Don’t be like that.

I was just keeping you warm while you slept.

Your body is a lot nicer than I expected.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Wh-What the heck is up with this guy…)</p>

<p class="t">(If I knew things would end up like this, then I would’ve kept watch all night without switching.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
There are only 22 people left.

You were such a big help taking out eight of them yesterday, <i>maci</i>.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
That’s only because you didn’t put in any work…

Anyway, we should get goin–*(Gasp!)*
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Rustling, then a gunshot.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Mob Prisoner A">
Guhk! I’m hit…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Mob Prisoner B">
Where?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
…!
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Gun loading and firing.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Mob Prisoner B">
Agh…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Kuguri-san, I got them!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Impressive! That makes ten&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
At least take out your weapon, will you?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Since you’re here, <i>maci</i>, I don’t really need to.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
…What’s this “maci” thing you keep talking about?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Starting to get curious, are you?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
No, I’m good. I just want to focus on staying alive right now. I’ll figure out everything else later.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
So cold. Oh, the sun’s coming up.

Look how pretty it is, <i>maci</i>.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Hold on a second!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(! A sniper at 10 o’clock?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Rustling.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tao">
...!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hu…h?
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Gunshot, then a thud.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tao">
J… Just in time…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Pushing me down so suddenly… You’re so assertive, <i>maci</i>&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
The hell?!

I only did that because you wandered out into the open!

Didn’t I tell you you’d be an easy target for snipers if you stand around with no cover?!
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_pX66ac0da0G1nYg2.webp?timestamp=1722551730494" alt="4"/>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oh, getting off of me already?

A shame, you should’ve savored it more.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Savored it…? What are you talking about? We’re playing a <i>Survival Game</i>, remember?!

*(Sigh)*... What a headache.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
… You’re quite the strange one, <i>maci</i>.

Is it even common nowadays for someone to be strictly heterosexual?

How odd.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
……

Can you stand?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Kuguri-san’s hands are… really cold. It’s like touching a machine…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
… The field keeps getting smaller and people are popping up more often. We should move quickly.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
No, it’s almost time. It’ll be fine.

Since you took care of everything in the way, everything else is moving a lot faster than I initially planned, <i>maci</i>.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
?

<p class="t">(Is there… something inside Kuguri-san’s ear piercing? I can hear some kind of feedback…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
…Mhm. Right. Just keep backing them into a corner.

I’ll be the one to deliver the final blow.

All you need to do is keep luring them.

Don’t worry, I have a <i>fantastic</i> meat shield here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Who is he… talking to?)</p>
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_27266ac0da0AGp33.webp?timestamp=1722551734017" alt="5"/>

<Narration>
<p><i>Gunshot.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Got him, let’s keep moving.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Understood.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
The sun’s rising, so we should be able to see better.

Three are trailing behind us, and two are coming from our left.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Footsteps confirmed. Your command?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Move right and out of their line of sight.

They’ll probably fight if we go around this next building.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Running footsteps.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Raito">
<p class="t">(That’s odd… The ones we set up aren’t shooting at each other. Instead, all five are coming for us?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
I see. It seems someone is ghosting us.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Ghosting?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
They can tell where we are and are leading us to a specific place.

…Well, it’s not hard to guess who's doing this is. Let’s take the chance and accept their invite.

Kinari, stay in that building’s shadows. At this rate, we’ll end up fighting close range, and you’ll be at a disadvantage.
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_z66ac0da0PMDHD21.webp?timestamp=1722551733702" alt="6"/>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
…If that is a command, I will comply.

However, I have no intention of remaining in the game. Kitakata Raito, do you intend to remain?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
I intend more to hold out, rather than remain…

You see, my motto is to give my all in everything I do.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
What’s the matter?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Human emotional data has been collected since my reset.

However, your emotions are difficult to parse given current data.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Both my sun and moon signs are Taurus.

I pride myself on being straightforward.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
…Your interest in astrology has already been recorded.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Haha. Alright then. If you follow along you might also have a bit of fun.

You only live once. Once you die you can’t feel happiness or suffering.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
…

<Bubble mc>
<em>Yaaaawn</em>…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Whoops! I’m yawning during work. I didn’t really expect the Survival Game would take a whole night…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard A">
10 are remaining.

All of them are headed towards the center area.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Tsk… So he managed to live...
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Um, from the looks of the monitor… It looks like there are three pairs and one trio.

That leaves just one… Hm?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wait a sec. That person with the black haired guy, wasn’t I just on a plane with him not too long ago [^1]?!)</p>

<p class="t">(I thought he was giving off some strange vibes… but I had no idea he was serving time here!)</p>

<p class="t">(Also… the blonde in that team there. He’s pretty attractive, but he looks familiar…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Nayuki-kun. Is that person with blonde hair… a celeb?

I get the feeling I’ve seen him somewhere before.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
I think that’s just your imagination.

He’s a criminal.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Whaaat? No, I’ve definitely seen him somewhere.)</p>
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_yKZnhe66ac0da0A6.webp?timestamp=1722551732932" alt="8"/>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Ah… AaaaaAAAAHHHHH!

There he is! There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, there he ISSSS!

Na! Tsu! Yaki! ChiHIII<i>ROOO!</i>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Huh? Wh-What?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
I <i>knew</i> it! We all believed in you, Chiiiii!

As expected of a true idol!

Good luck! Great luck, even! The best luck of all time!

Next, Chihiro will say “I’m fashionably late to the party, my bad☆” !!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ummmm… Ko-Kodama-san?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Augh! I-It’s not what you think!!!

I wasn’t worried about Chii because he hadn’t shown up on screen for a while or anything!!!

He’s just meant to be an idol!!

I’m not biased or anything… but still! It’s good that… he made it this far!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Is that pink haired person… Kodama-san’s oshi?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Divider loc="Central Courtyard" />

<Bubble character="Guard B">
Chii, if you hide in here you’ll be safe!

I’m gonna go, but just stay here!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Riiiiight, copy that ~☆

Thanks, Guardy ☆
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Running footsteps.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(<em>Sigh</em>...This whole thing’s gotta be a joke~)</p>
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;10 remain.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;In three minutes, the courtyard will be the only safe zone.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(Just the courtyard, huh… There’s no cover.)</p>

<p class="t">(A fight here would be insanely tough, wouldn’t it?)</p>

<p class="t">(Someone’s here!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Seems like we’re the first ones here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Kitakata Raito.

The previous pursuers have divided and are approaching.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Seems that… way!
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Gunshot.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Mob Inmate C">
Ughhk…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
According to my data… that person is one of your allies.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Yeah. Seems like he’s switched sides.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
<p><i>Gunshot.</i></p>
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Mob Inmate C">
Why… I was hidden so damn well too…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(That’s Raitin for ya… That’s some demonic reaction time!)</p>

<p class="t">(But wasn’t the person that was just shot from Raitin’s gang? I think Kugurin might’ve set them up~)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
It seems you have been double-crossed.

You are surprisingly disliked, Kitakata Raito.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Didn’t I say so already? Our opponent is like the Jack in Euchre.

He’s the only one that can turn the tables, no matter how strong our hand is.
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;2 eliminated. 8 remain.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Raito">
And…

It seems that trump card is making himself known.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(Two more people are here…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(! No way! Is that…)</p>

<p class="t">(Kugurin and…Taotao?!)</p>

<p class="t">(What are those two doing together?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hey there, King. It’s a shame you don’t look as desperate as I thought you would.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Kuguri. Seems like you’ve done quite a lot of scheming.

Did you get information beforehand from the guards?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hm, did I?

Anyway… I can finally show you what despair really is…&nbsp;♪
