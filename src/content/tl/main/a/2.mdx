Kitakata Raito.

…According to collected data, he is presently the leader of the most powerful faction on this island prison.

Also the founder of a metaverse community, an entrepreneur, and an investor. Ranked among the top in JPN’s “Most Desirable Lover” list for nine consecutive years.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Oh? You’re pretty informed.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari" name="500017">
Biometric scan results indicate that he is one hundred and eighty-two centimeters in height. His weight is–
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
H-hey! Bringing that up is rude!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Ahaha! You newcomers are rather funny.

As Number 17 said, I’m forming a group… or, rather, a gang in this prison.

There are other gangs too, but you would be better off joining one if you want to protect yourselves from people like the ones you just clashed with. If you wanted to join mine, I’d gladly welcome you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Gangs…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Right. Mine is the strongest, but there’s another one that rivals it.

I wouldn’t recommend that one though… Their leader is a bit difficult to deal with.

Number 10-kun, Number 17-kun. From what I’ve seen, you’re both model prisoners. So you two probably wouldn’t see eye to eye with him.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari" name="500017">
Invitation to faction declined.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Really… Any reason why?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari" name="500017">
A command system has already been implemented by the guards.

Multiple command systems run the risk of lag in computational processing.

<Bubble character="Raito">
Processing…?

Well, Number 10-kun, what about you?

Also, could you tell me your names?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari" name="500017">
Azekawa Kinari.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(! It really is Kinari… It’s the same name…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
I’m… Kinouchi Tao.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Kinari and Tao. In numerology, you two would be 8 and 1[^1].

Those are good numbers.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Nume… What now?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Well, you don’t need to answer right away. My motto is to think fast, but you both have plenty of time, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
? R-right…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Why is Raito-san saying that… as if <i>he</i> doesn’t have time?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Just a warning, the leader of my gang’s rival is…

Let’s see… In terms of Euchre[^2], if I were the King, then he’d be the Jack.

He’s dangerous, so be careful.

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(By Euchre… He meant the card game, right?)</p>

<p class="t">(The Jack is... something like a trump card. Kinda like a card that can change the course of the entire round in one go... I guess?)</p>

<p class="t">(Raito-san seems like a nice guy, but I don’t really know if I want to join his gang.)</p>

<p class="t">(Ever since I got here I’ve been trying to keep myself at arms length from people...)</p>

Sigh… What a pain…

Well hello there, Black Haired <i>Fiú [^3]</i>. What's got you sighing like that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
! Oh, nothing…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Wha… Isn’t this a solitary confinement cell? Why’s the door open?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="???">
Ufufu. It’s okay, you can take a peek. Behold my castle, <i>Fiú</i>.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(What’s a… “Fiú”…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Umm, I’m sorry. I was just cleaning…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="???">
Cleaning? Why don’t you stop doing such a boring chore and come chat with me instead?

Ohhh… Are you one of the new ones that got here yesterday? Number 500010… What a perfect number. We should have a waltz to celebrate.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(What’s… with this guy? Wait a second, why is there a guard inside the cell…? And why is the guard giving him a <b>back massage</b>?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="???">
Oh, are you curious about him?

Poor thing, this guard creature here. He thought he was keeping watch, but ended up being the imprisoned one instead…

So I let him touch my precious body, for at least a bit of comfort.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Spineless Guard">
Thank you very much, Kuguri-san…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="???">
That’s it... You’re so good at this.

Would you like to join us, <i>Fiú?</i>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
I-I’ll pass, thanks…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Hm? Could it be… Is this guy…?)</p>

<Bubble character="Kuguri" name="???">
I heard the King offered you an invitation to his gang yesterday. You haven’t joined it yet though, right?

I’m Domeki Kuguri. This island’s Emperor, and the guy who’s one step above the King.

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(! Domeki Kuguri! That would make him the guy King… No, Raito-san, said was dangerous!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Oh um… I’m sorry, I’m not really interested in the whole “gangs” thing…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
<i>Fiú</i>, there’s a bit of despair in your eyes. If you hung around me, I think that sweet despair could shine a <i>lot</i> brighter.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Ahaha… Well, anyone that ends up in a place like this has to have some despair in them.

This should be a fun way to kill time.
