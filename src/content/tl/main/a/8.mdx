<Bubble character="Raito">
So it came down to a showdown between us.

I had a feeling you’d been leading us here this whole time.

I figured you’d play along, even if you knew&nbsp;♪

<Bubble character="Raito">
…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Woah there! Your legs may be long, but you still can’t touch me!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Right back at you. You still haven’t hit me once!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(What kind of fighting style is <b>that</b>!? Kicking and shooting at the same time... Are they even human!?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Enemy Prisoner A">
Now! Take down Kitakata Raito and Domeki Kuguri!

All of you need to shut the <i>fuck</i> up!

Each and every single one of you are just a bunch of small fries!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(Does… Taotao turn into an entirely different person when he’s got a gun? His shooting is so good… He’s not some pushover after all!)</p>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Ch-Chii won! He really, really wonnnn…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
A-Ah! I got it!

Nayuki-kun, that man! He’s Kitakata Raito, an entrepreneur!

He’s the founder of “mahorova” who got arrested a while ago…

Look, his name and face are all over the internet.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Huh? Wait… Isn’t Nayuki-kun’s last name Kitakata too?)</p>

<p class="t">(Come to think of it, I think Kafka said that Nayuki-kun played a part in mahorova’s launch as the COO[^1].)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Nayuki-kun… is Kitakata Raito…

Your older brother…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
I don’t have a brother.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Eh? But wait, the internet says…

<p class="t">(...That they’re obviously brothers?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
…He should’ve dropped dead.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(This somehow feels like… a topic I shouldn’t pry into.)</p>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
*(Hum hum)*...♪ Allow me to introduce you to your future idols!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
…! Nayuki…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
<p class="t">(Oh? We sat next to each other on the plane...)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Well done, you lot!

Let me explain what the special prison activity is!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
U-Um! It’s nice to meet you!

I’m the chief of HAMA Tours, a travel agency.

I’m actually here to recruit you all…

To come to HAMA and become Ward Mayors, as well as the next local idol group!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
H-Huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Idols? Ward Mayors?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Y-yes. This might sound crazy, but the Survival Game was the audition.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Rejoice, you lot!

By becoming idols, you get parole and less time on your sentence!

Obviously, we’ll have to implant a microchip in you to keep you from escaping!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
A microchip…

Nevermind how they’re forgetting human rights, that’s just terrifying.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(So that "rightful place"… was just… this. I kinda… dunno how to feel about this.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Hey, hey, what’s the matter? You’re supposed to be happy, yknow!

Chii–I mean, No. 487116!

You should be the happiest!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Huh? Oh, right.

I am! I’m jazzed～☆
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
*(Giddy noises)* …!!!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(This idea really might be impossible after all?! Nobody really seems thrilled about this… What do I do with this atmosphere...)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Hm. I see. Come to think of it, today is Tenshanichi[^2] isn’t it?

The revolutionary planet, Neptune, and the planet of love, Venus are aligned. Is that what’s happening?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Wh-What?! He suddenly started talking about astrology?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Got it. Idols, right? Sounds fun.

Let’s do that next.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ummm… Raito-san?

Are you saying you’re okay with it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Precisely. The five of us forming a unit sounds like it’d be fun.

If it's possible, you should let me be the leader.

I’m good at leading groups.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oh really? Says the Naked King.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
R-Really?!

<p class="t">(I’m a little worried, but the fact that he’s logical and willing to take initiative is reassuring!)</p>

Just wait a moment, I’ll ask the president!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
<p class="t">(Hmmm…)</p>

<p class="t">(Well, it’s not the same as the leader… but Chii will definitely be the center.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I got the greenlight! Raito-san will be the leader, and the president wants you to come up with a unit name with a 3 in it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Roger. I’ll give it some thought.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Um… by the way, Nayuki-kun here is your manager.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
So you’re going to be handling that? What a relief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
.....

Everyone, please prepare to leave the island.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
New command system created.

Command processed.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<em>Sighs</em>… Well, whatever. I was gonna end up leaving anyway.

Taotao, are you tagging along~?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(They’re all talking so casually, but me? An idol? Is this some kind of joke? Ah but, I’ll probably be getting paid?)</p>

<p class="t">(If some kind of salary’s involved then I guess I can consider it...)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hmm…?

We met on the plane not long ago. Could this be fate?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
!!!

So you remembered me…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
I’ve got a good memory, <i>cicá[^3]</i>.

Idols, huh… I see how it is.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(What do I do? Is he going to say no…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Fine then.

It looks like a better stage has been set.

…To plunge the king into despair.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…Huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
See you later.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Um, it was a little forced… but we managed to form an idol unit just like Kafka planned! If that’s… how he planned it…?)</p>
</Bubble>
