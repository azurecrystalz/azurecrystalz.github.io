# Good Luck, Have Fun!

This is… incredible! All of this is footage of the island?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Exactly. There was a time where escape attempts from convicts were constant, so we installed cameras at all 300 posts on the island.

The footage changes every time a biological response is detected.

In other words! You can watch the <i>entire</i> audition right here from the comfort of this room…!

For an idol survival program, this is the best seat in the house!

Of course, this all comes with assorted color penlights that we’ve prepared right here for when you’ve found your favorite. We also have uchiwas[^1] that can be made with just the press of a button!

<Bubble mc>
R-Right…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Sounds like Kodama-san really loves idols… He’d probably get along well with Yachiyo-kun…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
So… Could you give us more information about this audition?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Certainly. The prisoners will be using this while participating in the survival game.
</Bubble>

This is… a digital paint gun, right? Like the kind that’s used in PVP games and shoots some kind of special ink.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
The guards on this island carry them on a day by day basis. The special ink sticks onto the prisoners’ uniforms, activating an anti-escape mechanism that paralyzes them.

In this instance, the prisoners will also be using them the same way. Upon being shot, the ink will paralyze the opponent.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
So they will be trying to take each other down?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Precisely. We’ll release the prisoners onto the island, and the five who survive until the end of this all out battle-royale… will become idols!!

And there you have it! The Idol <i>Survival Game!!!</i>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
The scales tip in favor of those with high physical and intellectual ability… I see, so that’s how Kafka set this up.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Momiji">
<p class="t">(I-If that’s the case, then there’s a chance that we’d end up with more violent prisoners… Wait, no. I decided it’s not good to judge. I’m still… a bit nervous though!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Anyway, let’s begin!!! <i>Finally.</i> At last, the day I would create an idol group with my own two hands has come! Gwaaah~! Their number one fan…will be <i>me!!!</i>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Ugh… What a headache…

<Bubble character="Guard A">
That’s far enough! Take off your blindfolds.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(What’s going on…? I was blindfolded out of nowhere this morning, then got dragged out here… What is this place?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Narration>
*Shuffling.*
</Narration>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;Attention all inmates. All prisoners have been routed to their specified starting points.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(? Starting points…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard A">
I’m heading back to my post. Just listen to the announcement.
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;The packs in front of you are camping supplies. Please take one each.&NoBreak;&gt;

&lt;&NoBreak;Five types of paint guns have been prepared for you. Please choose the one you prefer.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
There’s… sniper rifles and assault rifles… Submachine guns, shotguns, and handguns too…?

Are we doing a survival game?! Woah, these gun designs rock!
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;At this time, an explanation of the rules for today’s recreational activity, an island-wide battle-royale, will commence. All inmates…&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(No way… it’s <b>actually</b> a survival game?! What the hell, this sounds like a blast!)</p>

<p class="t">(Wait a second. Making any bold moves here and getting the attention of some dangerous guys isn’t good…)</p>

<p class="t">(When it comes to guns, a shotgun would be the best option… No, I can’t. If I get my hands on that, I’ll end up going all out.)</p>

<p class="t">(Maybe the sniper rifle then? For more undercover action…?)</p>

<p class="t">(No, not that either. The area might be pretty big, but the buildings are too close together. I don’t think it’d be easy to get a good shot. Mid-range shooting would be best for this place…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
I’ll go with the assault rifle.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
*Whiiir!*
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(! All the guns I didn’t choose just disappeared. Seriously, anything really <b>is</b> possible with science in this era…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;All guards have returned to their posts. At this time, the chief warden will explain today’s recreational proceedings.&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Narration>
*Intercom switch.*
</Narration>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;Alright, listen up! Today’s activities are a lot different than usual! Just one shot and you’re out!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;You’d better shoot faster than your ops if you want to live! Your uniforms were specifically tailored! If you get shot, then you’ll get hit with enough volts of electricity to drop a bear!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(For real…? I’d better steer clear of that.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;Areas inside of buildings and the docks are off limits, but you’re free to move around as much as you want anywhere else! However! The safe zone shrinks every hour!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;Anyone who steps outside the safe zone is automatically out! Use the map and your brains, knuckleheads! Stupidity won’t help you win!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
There was a map in the pack that I got…

<Bubble character="Tao">
Oh, the areas are color coded. Looks like we’re going to be pushed towards the center…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Not choosing the sniper rifle was a good move. With this setup, if you’re unlucky, then you’ll be out before you get the chance to act.)</p>

<p class="t">(Should I run to the center early on, then shoot people as they show up? Or should I take it slow and use the chaos at the center to my advantage?)</p>

<p class="t">(From my starting point, I’m gonna have to wait out the chaos. I should probably move around quietly and let the enemies take each other out.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;For the five of you that manage to make it to the end, there’s a reward waiting for you! It’ssss… a special prison activity! Rejoice!&NoBreak;&gt;
</Box>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Special prison activity? I wonder what that could be.)</p>

<p class="t">(Come to think of it… Chihiro mentioned that there would be a war. Could he have been talking about this?)</p>

<p class="t">(It might be in a prison… but my Survival Game Lover instincts are tingling! I don’t care about the rewards, I just want to be the last man standing!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Box type="radio">
&lt;&NoBreak;That’s all! Do your best to stay alive, scumbags! …GLHF! [^2]&NoBreak;&gt;
