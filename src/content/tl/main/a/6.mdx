<Narration>
*Gunfire.*
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Seems like it’s started. There’s a fight happening at my 3 o'clock. A lot of the newer people decided to take this survival game on their own.)</p>

<p class="t">(I should probably move to a different area for the first hour. Trying to wait out the chaos by myself would put me at a disadvantage. I need to find someone to team up with.)</p>

<p class="t">(Maybe Raito-san or Kuguri… -san… would work? They’re both in gangs that rival each other, so maybe joining one of them would give me better chances of winning.)</p>

<p class="t">(I need to buddy-up with <b>someone</b>, at the very least. It might be better to team up with Raito-san, since he was pretty nice.)</p>

<p class="t">(I should… probably try to avoid Kuguri-san. I’ll lay low so that I’m not spotted.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Oh, <i>man</i>. How long’s it been since I last seriously played a survival game? My blood’s pumping…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hey there. You’re pretty fast, <i>maci</i>.
</Bubble>

<Narration>
*Rustling and gun loading.*
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Kuguri-san?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(What’s a “maci”? Nevermind that, I didn’t expect to run into this guy so soon! This is a risky move, but…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Narration>
*BANG!*
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Sorry, I’m shooting!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Shooting first, warning after? So sneaky.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
?!

<p class="t">(I was definitely aiming for the right place… Did the ink not hit?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
So there is a feisty side to you. I’m starting to like you a lot more&nbsp;♪

<Bubble character="Tao">
Augh, wh–?! Let me go!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Nooope~ I’ve decided to use you as a meatshield, Number 10-kun.

Now, let’s go. Stay in front of me and walk, m’kay? Or else I might just shoot you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Are you serious…? Of all the people I could get caught by, it had to be the most troublesome one…)</p>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
……
</Bubble>

<Narration>
*Rustling!*
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Oh, Number 17… Or, rather, Kinari.

Standing out in the middle of the forest like this will get you shot.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Kitakata Raito.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
You’re by yourself? Looks like you’re using a sniper rifle as a weapon too…

Perfect. Would you like to work together?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
I have a handgun, so I’ll only be able to fight at close range.

I’ve been trying to find a sniper to team up with.

I’d appreciate having you cover me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
…Is that a command?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
A command? It’s more like an offer.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Currently, I’ve been temporarily removed from the warden’s command system.

If you are assuming command, I will comply.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Hmmm? Kinari, would you happen to be a Virgo with Mercury as your ruling planet?[^1]

You strike me as a serious revolutionary.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
According to my database, the correlation between zodiac signs and ruling planets is derived from statistics and general knowledge. Yet, the origin of the correlation has not been explained.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Ahaha, I’m sure.

Right, let’s go. My other comrades should be headed towards the center.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Command processed.

<Bubble character="Guard A">
Prisoner numbers 300005 and 498887 are working together, so are numbers 477771 and 500010.

Several people who attempted to advance alone have already been eliminated.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
I didn’t see that coming. Some people started shooting right off the bat, but others started teaming up…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Trying to attempt a survival game alone rarely works. It’s better to team up with someone who knows what they’re doing in order to increase chances of victory.

Prisoners who are serious about wanting to win will likely form two or three-man teams…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
You’re right, they generally ended up in pairs and trios.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(They need to be smart in order to win. We might end up with some pretty capable people!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Still… tsk.

<p class="t">(So he managed to find and pair up with someone with long range skills… Ever the lucky one…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Grrrr… Natsuyaki Chihiro…! Where are you? You’re the one that deserves to win…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(What’s wrong with the chief warden? He’s glued to the monitor and looks like… he’s looking for someone?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Come on… Lose and die already…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Something’s off with Nayuki-kun too… I hope this audition goes well… )</p>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Guardy, what’s going on~? Didn’t Kodamacchi say that hiding out in buildings was a no-go?

Is it really okay for Chii to be here?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
It-It’s fine! I want you to be the one that wins this game, Chii.

You’re meant to be the winner! I just <i>know</i> it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
*(Huffs)*…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Gotcha! So you’re gonna be looking after Chii, Guardy?&nbsp;♪

Thanksies~! XOXO&nbsp;☆
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
Hiyaaah...! I got a front row seat… to Natsuyaki Chihiro’s fanservice…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
But, are we gonna end up using the guns? Chii’s a pretty good shot~!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
KYAAAA...! Natsuyaki Chihiro’s fresh new look…! The gunslinger vibe makes such a good contrast…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Guardy~?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
Chii! Don’t worry.

Even if Chief Kodama said it wasn’t allowed… I’ll definitely help you to your rightful place…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Uh-huh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
When there aren’t many players left, I’ll call for you, so just stay here until then!

If you tell them you got lost in the woods then… it’ll be fine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Uh-huh…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
I’m… I’m the only one that gets it…!

Chii, you’re more innocent than anyone! Only you deserve that place!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Yaaaay, thanksss~
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard B">
I’ll see you later!

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
*(Sigh)*... “Innocent”, huh…

You aren’t looking at what’s behind the screen. So lazy.

People just expect me to be an idol all the time… Not that I care.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(Where would the “right place” even be for someone like me? I don’t… even know myself anymore.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Narration>
*Gunfire.*
</Narration>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Oh, it started? Isn’t it a bit early, though? Are they booting out the new guys right from the start?

Oh right, that new guy…

I wonder if he ended up joining a gang.

He looked a little weak, so he might not be around long.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
<p class="t">(He seemed like he didn’t know much about me. That was nice…)</p>
</Bubble>
