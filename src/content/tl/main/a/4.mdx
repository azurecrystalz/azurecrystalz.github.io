<Bubble mc>
Oh, I’m starting to see it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Is that so…
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Nayuki-kun doesn’t seem too thrilled… Maybe he wasn’t too keen on coming after all.)</p>

<p class="t">(Not only that, but I need to be more careful. Back when I was in Shodoshima, I got sunburned and that made things pretty difficult later on. So, I should make sure to wear my cap now…)</p>

<p class="t">(Kafka was fussing over it earlier. He made me bring it and even insisted that I wear it properly… He’s such a worrywart.)</p>

<p class="t">(The “Monkey’s Cage” prison island… I never thought I’d end up at a place like this while doing work for HAMA.)</p>

<Bubble mc>
Eh? You want to form another idol group and launch their debut?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Yeah. R1ze and Day2 got pretty popular, especially all of their Hospitality shows.

So I want to make an evening group of idols that Nayuki will be in charge of.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
Th-That sounds awesomeee…! I’m-I’m-I’m all for it…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Having idols locally is a highlight to any tourist area. Also, we have Nanaki now. He can compose music. Doesn’t seem like a bad plan, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Daniel">
Weee~ll, doesn’t that sound nice? I don’t see anything wrong with what the president’s sayin’!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Yes, Bocchama’s idea is quite insightful. Establishing a bit of variety with a third group is a splendid idea.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(If Kafka’s this confident about it, then it should be okay. It probably means we’ve got a high chance of success.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What about you, Nayuki? Any thoughts?
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_TSBXU066abea44Z6.webp?timestamp=1722542674585" alt="2" />

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
…Even if I had any, hasn’t everything already been decided?

This is something you want me to handle.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
You’re in an unusually bad mood today. At any rate, I’m sure you and Shunin-chan will be able to pull through.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Huh? Is Nayuki-kun mad? There’s no way… Someone as calm as him could never get angry.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
…Well, I can understand the president’s perspective on it.

The areas we’d be responsible for, Wards 10 to 14, don’t have many tourist attractions. What they do have are lots of famous venues. Not taking advantage of them would be a waste.

The problem is, unlike the previous groups, the wardens wouldn’t just be singing, they’d be participating in idol activities too. There’s going to be risks that come up.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Risks?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Simply put, scandals. The biggest obstacle would be maintaining a reputation. All it would take is one scandal, and everything would fall apart.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
That’s Nayuki for you. Seems like you have a good understanding of things.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
P-Personally, as an idol fan… I don’t know how I feel about idols quitting after just one scandal…

When I think about how many idols have disappeared that way…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Sakujiro">
Fuefuki-kun. Your nose is running, allow me to wipe it for you. There, there.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Yachiyo">
<i>(Hic. Sobs.)</i> You’re too kind, <i>(Blubbering)</i> Thankyousomuchhh…<i>sniff</i>…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
To make sure passionate fans like Yachiyo don’t get hurt, reputation management is our biggest priority.

Which is why this time I’m going to use a bit of an unconventional approach when forming this idol group.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…? An unconventional approach?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
What if we picked idols that are already hated? That way, it’s only up from there.

Wouldn't it be nice to have idols who show off their flaws and captivate others with their way of life?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
It’s quite the gamble, to be honest. It’s risky, there’s too much guessing involved.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kafka">
Well then… Should we make a bet?

This is a gamble I think I can win.

<p class="t">(Making an idol group with prisoners as members who have negative reputations right from the get-go… There’s no way…)</p>

<p class="t">(Kafka’s ideas are as crazy as ever.)</p>

<p class="t">(Prisoner idols… Prisoners as tourist Ward Mayors… The bar is set way too high…)</p>

<p class="t">(But, being judgy just based on a criminal track record isn’t fair! Who knows, this might turn out to be a good opportunity!)</p>

<p class="t">(But… Nayuki-kun has been tense this whole time. So maybe he really isn’t on board with the idea.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Sigh… It seems we’ve arrived. Damn it.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
N-Nayuki-kun! Nice weather we’re having!

By the wayyy, has Kafka told you anything about how we'll be choosing the members?

I tried asking, but he kept it a secret and wouldn’t tell me…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
Well, I’m not sure of any preparations the president may have made either…

Regardless, we’ll only choose those who are model prisoners. Any misfits with no societal value or will to live will be eliminated. Simple as that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
N-Nayuki-kun…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Could it be… Nayuki-kun is mad after all…?)</p>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Welcome to the Land of The Apes, the “Monkey’s Cage”!

I’m Kodama, the chief warden.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
It-It’s nice to meet you.

Um… Where are all the prisoners?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(There’s nobody here. How are we supposed to pick?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
Don’t you worry. This is all according to the 0th Ward Mayor’s plans.

Both of you come with me to a separate room. You’re about to see a <i>veeery</i> special audition.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
A special audition…?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kodama">
I’ll tell you what! Kodama here has his own take on idols!

Yeeeesss… The idol industry is <i>truly</i> a world of survival of the fittest… where only the <i>strongest</i> survive!

Luck, wits, and skill! These are all the qualities every idol should have!

<i>Aaaand <b>that</b> is why!</i> We’ll be having a <i>Survival Audition</i> right here, right now!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Huh? <b>Huuuh?!</b> A Survival Audition…?! What does <b>that</b> mean?!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nayuki">
That Kafka… So he’s already laid out the groundwork, huh… He’s trying to disrupt my plans…
