<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Sigh. I accidentally got myself wrapped up with someone dangerous… Anyone who has the guards doing their bidding is definitely bad news.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
This seat’s empty… I guess I’ll eat here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Well, at least there’s food here in prison… Even if it <b>does</b> look and smell like garbage. Compared to being out on the streets, this is heaven.)</p>

<Bubble character="Chihiro" name="???">
Oissu-chii~! Chiitizensss! Are you all aliiive?

Today I’m gonna be showing you allll of this island prison’s grub!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="InmateA">
Ugh, not this guy again…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="InmateB">
I don’t give a damn if he’s an “influencer” or whatever, he’s the only one here eating good.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(What the…? A camera?! Is he recording inside the prison?! Not only that, but he’s the only one eating something different too…?)</p>

<p class="t">(What the heck is an “Influenza” anyways? He doesn’t… look that sick to me.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro" name="???">
There's salaaaad, hayashi riiiice, and pudding for desserrrrrt~! Aren’t the cherry tomatoes on the salad seriously just the <i>cutest?</i>

The red gives it <i>suuuch</i> a nice pop, Chii is totally into it!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(I can’t figure out half of what he’s talking about…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro" name="???">
Om~ Mmm, yummyyy!

Chiitizeeens~! If you thought today’s lunch looked super good, hit that like button!

<Bubble character="Chihiro" name="???">
Alright, here's today's videoooo~ Guard-san, edit it all nice and spiffy~!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Guard A">
Humph! For a fraud, you sure act all high and mighty.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Fraud…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro" name="???">
Hm? Whatcha lookin’ at? Were you checking Chii out? Are you a newbie?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
...!

Oh, sorry. You kinda stood out, so…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro" name="???">
No biggie! Standing out is part of the whole influencer thing~☆

Is it all good if I sit here? By the way, I’m Natsuyaki Chihiro! You can call me Chii, though~!

And you areeee~?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Uhhh… I’m Tao.

<p class="t">(So easygoing! Is he some kinda gyaru…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Taotao it is~!

It’s okay to use your first name right? We’re like the same age anyway~
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Um, what are you filming for…? Or actually, what <i>were</i> you filming for?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Ohhhh, that. I have like a hundred million followers, so I was put in charge of boosting the prison’s rep. Some kinda special gig like that~
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(Followers…? I don’t really get it but I guess it means he gets a lot of influence. Good meals, too. Fixing up this place’s image sounds like a lie…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Buuut being stuck in jail isn’t exactly super glamorous… It’s starting to feel like a <i>toootal</i> drag~

Oh, Taotao! Wanna guest in one of my vids~? You’re so tall, so we’d make a good duo while filming, right?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Huh? I… don’t really do well on camera.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Really?

Ahh, I’m totally stuffed! Dessert tiiiime&nbsp;♪ Taotao, do you want any of my leftovers~?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
But you’ve barely had anything to eat, Chi…hiro. Would you even be able to do any duties on an empty stomach…?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Huhhh~? Well even if Chii’s on duty, he’s still pretty buddy-buddy with the guards n’ stuff&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Didn’t they call you a fraud…?
</Bubble>

<StoryImg src="https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_s4CW66abe5c9DBJ4.webp?timestamp=1722541528404" alt="4"/>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Well yeah, because Chii’s in for fraud.

But I didn’t do it with bad intentions, okay?! Getting me here was all part of the PR strat.

Oh, but the scandal kinda <i>waaaas</i> my fault~!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(For such a weird guy he’s… pretty honest?)</p>

Hey, you know how there are gangs here in this prison? Are you in any of them?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Gangs? Like the ones the King Kitakata Raito and that quirky Doumeki Kuguri guy are running?

Chii isn’t really in any of those since he’s always on the guards’ good sides, buuuut you should probably join one of them, Taotao~
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
Are those the only two options?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Uuuum, well there <i>were</i> a few guys that ran the place before those two got here…

But, y’know, Raitin and Kugurin aren’t exactly enemies.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
<p class="t">(“Raitin”...? “Kugurin”…?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Taotao, you get a special First Meeting Bonus from me~&nbsp;♪

I heeeaaard that a little <i>something</i> was happening real soon&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
……？
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
There’s. Gonna. Be. <i>Waaar</i>&nbsp;♪
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Spineless Guard">
Kuguri-san… This is the next recreational program...
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oh? Is that so?

What a perfect chance… to show the Naked King[^1] despair.
