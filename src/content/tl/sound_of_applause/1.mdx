<p class="t"> (As I thought, it really *was* a good idea to come out into the city today. There are more new shops than last time I came here for research!)</p>

<p class="t"> (I wanted to gather intel on hidden gems for HAMA Tours...)</p>

Alright, the next spot is…huh?

<p class="t"> (Over in the crowd there, is that...Kuguri-san?)</p>

Ah…Kuguri-san, you dropped your handkerchief!

…Aaand he’s gone.

<p class="t"> (Actually, Kuguri-san has always been the type to disappear out of the blue. I don’t have any idea what he does on his days off.)</p>

<p class="t"> (Even on one of his more recent ones, Kuguri-san wasn’t around and everyone on the Evening Team didn’t know where he was.)</p>

<Bubble character="Chihiro">
Eh? You’re wondering what Kugurin does on his days off? Chii's got no clue. What about you, Taotao?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Tao">
I don't really know either…I look away from him for a second, and he’s gone.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Raito">
Yeah. Additionally, if you *do* ask him where he’s gone, he never confesses anything.

<Bubble character="Kinari">
Commencing search for “Possible Activities on Domeki Kuguri’s Day Off”.

—-Relevant information unavailable. I can conduct additional research if you’d like, Master.

<p class="t">(I’m pretty curious…and I still need to give him back his handkerchief, so I’ll follow him!)</p>

I think he went this way…

There he is! Oiiiii, Kuguri-saaaaan…!

<p class="t">(From this distance, he *should* be able to hear me. That’s weird.)</p>

Kuguri-san, please wait!

<p class="t">(He totally didn’t notice me…)</p>

Huh? I never knew there was a cafe here. I smell coffee…

<Bubble character="Granny Cafe Owner" name="Granny Cafe Owner">
Oh hello there, youngun. Are you out on a walk?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Yo, *lány*[^1]. It’s good to see you’re well.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Granny Cafe Owner" name="Granny Cafe Owner">
It’s all thanks to you. See for yourself, I do my daily squats!

Anyhoo…you always look so wonderful in your outfits. Where do you buy them?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
That’s a secret.

You always seem to want to pry into my business every time you see me, *lány*. Is it…that you like me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Granny Cafe Owner" name="Granny Cafe Owner">
Oh my! Don’t tease your elders now…what about coffee? Would you like some?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Nope, I have plans later. I’ll stop by to visit another time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Ah, he’s leaving. I have to catch up!)</p>

This place…I’ve never been here before.

<p class="t">(Looks like there’s a bunch of stores selling handcrafted clothes and accessories here. It’s fun just looking at them.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri Fan A" name="Kuguri Fan A">
Kyaaah! Kuguri?! I-I-I-I can’t believe we’re meeting in a place like this!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri Fan B" name="Kuguri Fan B">
Crap, my phon–No, shouldn’t I admire him with my naked eye first?! Wh-wh-what do I do?!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Do whatever you'd like. What do you want to do to me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri Fan C" name="Kuguri Fan C">
I want to turn into a wall and stare at you…!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(Subject aside, it looks like Kuguri-san can hold normal conversations with people.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
—It’s time. See you later. Until fate brings us together again.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t">(This isn’t the time to be surprised. I need to catch up before I lose him!)</p>

*(Pant, pant...)*

<p class="t"> (I’ve been running around in so many circles, I’m starting to lose steam.)</p>

<p class="t"> (Not only that, but Kuguri-san walks so fast. I have to keep my stride or else I’ll lose sight of him…!)</p>

<p class="t"> (Ah, there! He’s looking this way. Maybe he finally noticed me this time…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
…Fufu.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (...No way. It was on purpose.)</p>

<p class="t"> (He noticed I was chasing him and he’s been running away on purpose this whole time!)</p>
