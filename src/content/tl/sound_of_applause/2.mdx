<p class="t"> (...Why, did it end up like this?)</p>

<p class="t"> (I got lost along the way. I lost sight of Kuguri-san for just a split second. All because I dropped my phone…!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A" name="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A">
Oi, are you listening, that’s the person who bumped into me! I’ll make you pay up *double*!
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (I’m getting caught up in something again–!!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Thug B, With Pants Barely Hanging on" name="Thug B, With Pants Barely Hanging on">
We’ve been eating out too much, so we’ve drained Aniki’s Pay balance down to zero. At this rate, we'll end up having to walk all the way back to Chiba. Isn't that a shame?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Th-that’s probably better for your health…

<p class="t"> (He grabbed my arm, and there’s no one around to call for help…this isn’t good.)</p>

<p class="t"> (I need to get out of here, but I’m at a 2v1 disadvantage–)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
That’s enough. Can’t you tell you and your wild behavior is ruining the city’s scenery?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A" name="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A">
Huuuh? What’s with you? Get out of my way!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oh my, it seems like you’re deaf too.

Or are you doing this on purpose to annoy me?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A" name="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A">
Hah? Don’t spout nonsense you–gh!

Wha… My punch… he caught it? Wh-what’s with this guy… h-he didn’t even flinch!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Fine. If that’s how you want it…I’ll stick around until you're blubbering and begging for forgiveness.

There’s lots of ways to tame a dog. Maybe after “shake”, I’ll get you to “sit”?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A" name="Suprisingly Quick-Lived Thug A">
Tch… Fine, I’ll give you back your phone! Next time I see you, you’d better pay up!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Thug B, With Pants Barely Hanging on" name="Thug B, With Pants Barely Hanging on">
Better remember that!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
What a cliche way to say goodbye. If you’re going to throw around insults, at least make it more exciting.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (Did Kuguri-san…just come to my rescue?)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oya, what are you doing here? *Cicá*[^1].
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
No, you *had* to have noticed I’ve been following you this whole time.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Fufu… Once I saw your cheerful face I really couldn’t help but play along.

Congrats on reaching your goal. Are you going to return that handkerchief to me now?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (So you really did drop it on purpose!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
It was *such* a fun time being under your watchful eye, *cicá*. What a nice date.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
This isn’t a date…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oya, you still aren’t satisfied? How greedy of you, *cicá*.

Well then, how about a real date?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Eh?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Think of it as a “thank you” for returning what’s mine. I’ll take you somewhere nice. Now, come.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah, w-wait…!
</Bubble>

<p class="t"> (I didn’t think there’d be a bar in a place like this. The ambiance and interior design are so nice.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Bar Owner" name="Bar Owner">
Welcome back, Domeki-sama.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hey there. As usual, table for two.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (I wonder if he’s a regular here. Seems like he knows the owner…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
I’ll treat you to a glass of my favorite Hungarian wine today, *cicá*.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Th-that’s alright. I can pay for it myself.

<p class="t"> (Kuguri-san treating me, it's kinda scary…)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Ah… Kuguri-san, your arm is hurt.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oya. I had maintenance[^2] done on them today, but I suppose it’s because of those delinquents from earlier.

This isn’t a big deal. Having scratch marks left on your body is like having a cute way to resist.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
…It’s because you protected me. I’m so sorry.

Not only that, but I haven’t thanked you for that yet either. So, thank you for helping me.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hm. I’m not so sure I know what you’re talking about.

But, if you’re trying to say that I was injured because of you... then you *should* be able to accept me treating you, no? 
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
 …I guess so. I’ll be in your care then.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
That's a good *cicá*.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Bar Owner" name="Bar Owner">
Thanks for waiting. There you go, enjoy.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Thank you...oh, this is really good！
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Isn’t it? Tokay[^3] wine has a smooth flavor and it’s quite easy to drink.

This bar certainly doesn’t disappoint when it comes to Hungarian wine.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (Today was a rollercoaster… but I think I’ve seen a different side of Kuguri-san that I couldn't see before.)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
…Fufu.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
Wh-what is it?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
You were looking for hidden gem spots in HAMA today, no?

I’ve tried to share a few places myself… but I find this particular bar to be my favorite. 

You can show it off all you’d like, but let’s keep the wine as our little secret, alright?
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
G-got it.

<p class="t"> (Oh. Wait a second.)</p>

<p class="t"> (Kuguri-san knew what I was up to this whole time? I didn’t tell anyone about my research either!)</p>
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Mhm, delicious. Tonight’s drink seems especially exquisite.
</Bubble>

<Bubble mc>
<p class="t"> (...Nevermind. Kuguri-san really is a mystery.) </p>
</Bubble>
