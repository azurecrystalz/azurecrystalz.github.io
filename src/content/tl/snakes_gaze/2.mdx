Ufufu, well aren’t you just the cutest?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Snake" name="Snake">
Hisssss ♪

<Bubble character="Nagi">
It ended up wrapping itself around your arm like it was shaking it, Kuguri-san…

I’m picking up a strong, foreboding scent… I can see black roses[^1] behind you too.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Snake" name="Snake">
Hiss… hissss~
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hmm… It seems this little one’s a pet snake.

Its cage was left open by accident, and it ended up in this alley when it wandered out for a little stroll.

It might’ve had a little scare when you suddenly froze up after it wanted to ask you how to get back home.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
You can understand it…? That’s amazing.

I’m sensing there might even be something god-like at play here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
It’s just like talking to a dog or cat.

But… they’re quiet and voiceless creatures.

The fact that they can’t cry or scream is why I prefer them.

I prefer that even more in humans.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
…Nagi? What’s the matter?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
……
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Did the snake’s gaze turn you into stone?[^2]
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
………

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Or is there, perhaps, something on my face?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
…! Bwah…!

B-Being this close to someone so beautiful, that’s… bad for the heart…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
What a strange boy you are, suddenly going all quiet like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Oh. It’s just that you said you usually prefer humans quiet, Kuguri-san…

Yet here I was going on and on about the best way to die…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
So you not only stopped talking… but you even held your breath?

Ufufu, you have such an odd way of thinking.

I don’t hate people with interesting things to say, you know.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
You don’t hate them… Okay, good. That’s a relief.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Now, how about we take this little one back to its owner?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Snake" name="Snake">
Hiss~!
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
I’ll tell some of my funniest tales on the way, then.

My leg hath been bitten by a snake, bringing me to a tragic end. O’ snake…
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
 …We won’t be needing any of that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Snake" name="Snake">
*Hisssss!*
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Got it. I’ll shut up then.
