<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Nagi? What are you up to, standing as still as a statue in a place like this?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Shhh… keep it down a little.

Don’t come any closer either.

I’m bracing myself for death at the moment.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Hm? And why is that?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Snake" name="Snake">
Hiss… hisssss…~
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Oh, it looks like we have quite the beauty hidden in the darkness here.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Yeah… those glowing eyes.

It has to be a sign that it’ll strike at the slightest movement…

<Bubble character="Nagi">
After being caught under this snake’s gaze, there is only one thing a humble florist on his way back from a delivery could do when he’s on death’s door…

And that’s picking the best way to die.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
“The best way to die”?

Interesting. Those are pretty bold words coming from said humble florist.

What kind of death did you decide on?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
For starters, snakes have poisonous fangs.

So getting bit and dying from the poison is an option.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
But poison would take a long time to spread through my body, so it’ll be long and painful.

The same would go for something like aconite[^1]. So, I’d like to avoid that option if I can.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
Is that so?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
There’s also being swallowed whole, but that would be painful and it would take too long for me to be digested. 

It’d be like how pitcher plants work.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
True, but it doesn’t look big enough to manage something like that.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Well then, the only option left would be for it to wrap around my neck and suffocate m–
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Hm? Oh, it’s you, Kuguri-san.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
You’re only now realizing?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Sorry, I was in such a panic I didn’t notice you.
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Kuguri">
That’s a rather interesting way to panic.

Nevermind that, is this snake really so vicious?
</Bubble>

<Bubble character="Snake" name="Snake">
Hisssss…!

<Bubble character="Nagi">
Oh, if you get any closer, it’ll–
