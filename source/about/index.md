Hiii! I’m Aurora this is a bit of a passion project of mine! This is the site I’m using to store my translations! Japanese is a language spoken in my household so I’m using translations as a way to hone my reading skills! ***This website is currently in the process of having things transferred from tumblr + proofread. My old masterlist is still up if you want to read the unproofed versions of my tls.***

Just a heads up: I try to get as close to colloquial English as possible when translating to practice my English too, so some sentences may deviate a bit from the original text.

You're more than welcome to join my [archive discord](https://t.co/uCDQXfvgF8)! Apart from the fact that I use it to store tls/update ppl with new chapters and stuff, it's a cool place to hang out!
