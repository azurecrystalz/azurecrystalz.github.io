Hi I'm Aurora, I'm a CrazywinkP that loves them sooosososo much. I translate mostly Crazy:B content, though you may see me add things for 2wink or for other idols that I'm biased towards. I'm a university student with a work-heavy unpaid internship, so my translation updates may be spotty based on my motivation + workload.

I used to take translation requests, but I've decided to indefinitely not do that mostly because of the school + work things. That being said, I will ignore any asks in my curiouscat/tmblr inbox asking me to translate specific stories or to open requests again.

Just a heads up: I try to get as close to colloquial English as possible when translating to practice my English too, so some sentences may deviate a bit from the original text.
