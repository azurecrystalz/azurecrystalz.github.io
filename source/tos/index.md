- Please don't repost my translations.
- Please do not submit my translations to quote accounts.
- Please don't use my translations in automated bot accounts, whether it’s for personal use or public.
- Please don’t use screenshots of my translations for character analysis purposes. Screenshotting a detail you find cute/funny/sad/interesting is totally cool though and I 100% encourage it ^^;
- Please don't use my translations to train AI or use them to create character bots.
- If you'd like to use my song translations for lyric videos or edits, you're welcome to do so as long as there is ***clear, visible credit*** either in the video or in the description.
- If you’d like to use my translations to translate into another language you’re free to do so!
- If you’re making a masterlist of translations and would like me to be included you’re more than welcome to link my things, just please shoot me a message on discord.

My translations are all for **non profit** purposes.
