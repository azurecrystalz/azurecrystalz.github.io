  Such wise words. Nobody understands Reito like Sanseiu-sensei.

  No matter how many times I read it, it’s peak. It was worth taking the first train of the day to get to the venue. The cosplayer that was helping out at the booth was seriously skilled, too…

  …

  If you’re just gonna say “it’s nothing”, then why do you even bother opening your mouth in the first place?

  The flavor changes depending on how you brew it. Shouldn’t you know that as a member of the cooking club?

  Oh… Right, sorry, I forgot. You probably can’t even taste the difference if all of your taste buds are shot because of that god awful Dr. Ghost Pepper.

  It’s been a while since I’ve fallen from the second floor… It’s usually from the fourth or fifth floor as of late.

  <div class="msr-narration">
  <p><i><b>Location:</b>HAMA House - Conference Room</i></p>
  </div>

  {% bubble Kafka %}
  Alright, everyone’s here.

  Now then, let’s begin today’s meeting.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Akuta %}
  Hell yea! It’s about time!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  I will explain the situation.

  We’ve called you all here today to discuss a collaboration between companies.

  We’ve been asked to participate in “mahorova CosFest vol.1”, also known as “mahoCos” for short. It is a full-dive cosplay event that will take place inside of mahorova.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Chihiro %}
  Ehh, a collab with THE mahorova!?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Renga %}
  That’s a crazy huge deal…!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Indeed. The primary objective of mahoCos is to promote the re-release of a costume app that users can set as avatars inside mahorova.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kafka %}
  HAMA’s been the talk of the town as of late ♪

  Therefore, we want you, as the acting ward mayors, to participate in this event and liven things up.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  The theme of the event is “Ayakashi [^3]”.

  In order to implement the costumes into the app, we’d like you to prepare designs based on that theme.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …

  <th><i>(I’m interested in cosplaying in mahorova, but… That theme is <b>so</b> boring. There’s gotta be <b>something</b> more interesting they can do, right?)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Raito %}
  Nayuki, have the participating mayors or any potential candidates already been decided?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  …I feel as though somebody just asked about the participants. Here is what we have as of right now.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  …N-Nayuki-kun didn’t acknowledge Raito-san at all…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  The event administration has extended an offer to Domeki-san.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Hm? Me?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Much to my delight, it seems that someone among the management is a big fan of Ev3ns.

  They’re especially fond of Domeki-san, so they were really hoping that he would participate.

  Furthermore, Domeki-san’s disposition suits the “Ayakashi” theme quite well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(Haah? What the hell. What kind of cheap abuse of power is this?)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Fufu… It's not like I can help it if that little lamb has such fine taste.

  Alright, I’ll do it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Thank you. Next, I’d like to request someone myself.

  Azekawa-kun, I would like to nominate you as a participant.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Command processed.

  Manager, please provide an explanation for your appeal to assist in decision-making.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  This request also involves reviews of the costume app.

  Thus, I would like you to serve as a record-keeper for the participants’ opinions as well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Master. May I accept this order?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Of course you can!

  Kinari-kun’s specialty is collecting data, after all!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Understood. Command processed.

  Updating priority queue.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Alright, then we’ve decided on two participants.

  If anyone else is interested, please let us know.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Ah, if Kugunii… If Doumeki-san is going to be there, I think I’d like to join too.

  I’d like to try working with him.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh? How cute of you, Nanaki.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(Ughhh. Those relatives sure are buddy-buddy.)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Then Nanaki-kun will be joining as well. Anyone else?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Oh, right, cosplay is Sakujiro-san’s specialty!

  If he can advise us regarding the costumes—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Sakujiro %}
  I’m terribly sorry, but my schedule is packed full.

  I have not a moment of rest until the day of the event. I fear it will be quite the challenge to provide my expertise this time around.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  I see… In that case, the rest of us will just have to do our best.

  Ayakashi is a really interesting theme…!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …I don’t think so at all.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Eh?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Isn’t it a bit too spontaneous to throw in Domeki-san just because he happens to look the part?

  To start with, Ayakashi is all about yokai, right? That’s pretty basic for a cosplay theme.

  You really wanna use that outdated theme for an app’s PR? Isn’t it missing something fresh and innovative?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Um… I… guess so?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  …Fufu.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …What’s so funny, Domeki-san?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh, nothing. I was just wondering what the problem would be with something "basic".

  Isn’t figuring out how to play around with such an everyday theme the fun part?

  Or is that level of creativity a little too challenging for you?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  That’s not what I’m saying.

  <th><i>(I’m no Karigane-san, but I’m by no means a stranger to cosplay.)</i></th>

  Just… from what you guys were saying earlier, this is an insane offer, but is it really okay to be so nonchalant about this whole thing?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  *(Sigh)*... You really can’t get enough of complaining about every little thing, can you.

  Just yesterday, wasn’t it you who said “It’s like there’s people who don’t know the basics of communication”?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Haah?

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  You’re still fighting? Calm down, you two–

  …Ah. Deja-vu.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  A-Ahh…!

  Nagi-kun just tripped over his own two feet…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  The force of impact from falling into the desk caused Nanamegi-sama and Kurama-sama’s drinks to…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Hot… No, it’s cold… No, it’s perfectly room temperature.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble NU2 %}
  Why the hell did it only spill directly onto Hachinoya-san!?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Huh. The scalding hot coffee canceled out the ice-cold Dr. Ghost Pepper to save me.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kafka %}
  Ahaha! You’re all perfectly in sync ♪

  Nayuki, as for the remaining members, let’s add Ushio and… It’ll get interesting if we add Nagi, too. Isn’t this a fine team of 5?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Well, that’ll do.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}

  Woah, so this is a “Bio Avatar.” This might be the first time I’ve used this kind of thing in mahorova.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Bio Avatar… An abbreviated name for Biometric Scan Avatars, created by utilizing data from real-world body scans to achieve an avatar that closely resembles the user’s real-world appearance.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  I see… The other people around here definitely don’t look like sea creatures. I won’t have to worry about being crushed by a yokozuna slickhead.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Besides that, the positive opinion of Bio Avatars is largely due to the ability to come into contact with others within the virtual space.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(Contact… with others….)</i></th>

  …!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Participant %}
  Ah, my bad.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Don’t worry about it.

  <th><i>(Damn… even just barely touching is no good.)</i></th>

  <th><i>(So it’s still impossible even through an avatar…)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Huh? That guy just now, I feel like I saw them on TV the other day…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Now that you mention it, that person over there’s an artist who's been making waves lately…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Even *I’ve* seen all of the people here before.

  So we really were invited to such a high-profile event…

  …Chief. I’m sorry, but let’s triple the amount of flowers planned for tomorrow... No, quintuple—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Apologies for the delay. The briefing session ran a bit long.

  It seems you all managed to login with the Bio Avatars just fine.

  Have you had the chance to try out the costume app?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Ah, Nayuki-kun. We were just about to do that.

  There’s tons of default costumes in here, but you can also make your own designs….

  You really can create a completely personalized cosplay with this.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Indeed. The system is also quite simple to use.

  That being said… There’s one thing the president wants you to be aware of.

  On the day of the event, the team selected by the judges will win the privilege of having their designs displayed in the heart of mahorova for one week.

  This is a perfect opportunity to promote HAMA Tours, so he’s hoping that the five of you will go for the prize.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Well then… I'll go for this serpent outfit. It's a bit on the revealing side.

  Reptiles and I are quite compatible creatures, you know.

  Nagi, what do you think? Isn’t it a perfect fit for me?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  It certainly is revealing… That’s a lot of skin showing.

  It looks like it’d get chilly, and besides, it’s geared towards professional cosplayers.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  And? There's nothing wrong with shedding a few layers.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  That'll just make it even colder... but I guess that's the cost of being stylish.

  A bold yet stoic choice, as expected of you, Kuguri-san. I’ll have to take a page out of your book.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Look, Nanaki-kun. Isn’t this Kappa costume cute?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Eh!? Yeah, Kappa… Um, it’s cute… yeah.

  <span style="font-size:small; line-height: .5em;">I think it would be cuter on you, Chief…</span>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Huh? I’m sorry, could you say that one more time?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  T-The Kappa!! I-It’s super cute!!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Shut up.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Kinari-kun, what do you think? Any costumes that catch your eye?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  I have no particular preference.

  I will leave the choice to Master's discretion.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIA %}
  Pfffft. Did you hear that? “Master’s discretion,” he said.

  Are there really such boring, mannequin-like people at this event?

  They don’t seem to be anyone noteworthy, unlike us.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIB %}
  Oh, did you catch the film show last Friday? The one with the android in the supporting role. Doesn’t he remind you of it?

  That android’s facial expressions were horrendous~ The fact that it didn’t look alive was a toootal turn off~

  Well, at least the foil character was pretty good.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  …
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  …Um. That was a bit ru–
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Maaan.

  People who need to look down on others to maintain their pride are such a sorry sight.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIA %}
  …Eh?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Personally, I sure hope I won’t become a shallow adult like that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIB %}
  Hold it, what was that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  It’s nothing. Didn’t you say something about going to a film show last Friday?

  The one about humans being way more repulsive than androids, right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIA %}
  Eh, what? This blows… Let’s just go.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  U-Ushio-kun! You crossed a line there.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  So what? I thought I’d teach them a lesson, since they <em>clearly</em> can’t recognize bad manners despite their age.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  But, that was quite aggressive…

  That said, I’m happy that you got mad on behalf of Kinari-kun.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Kurama-sama. I apologize for causing you trouble.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Nah. It’s not like it was any trouble… or anything.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Well, let’s pull ourselves together and think about what to do for Kinari-kun’s costume.

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  If there's anything I can do to be of assistance, pray tell.

  <div class="msr-narration">
  <p><i>Flashback start.</i></p>

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Hey, Azekawa-san. You don’t have anything particular in mind for your cosplay outfit, correct?

  If so, is it okay if you let me take care of it?

  Those guys from earlier were just going on and on…

  Running their mouths, calling you a mannequin, or saying that you “can’t be considered a living being” and such. I want to design something that’ll make them eat their shitty words.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  I do not mind so long as Master allows it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  …Hmm. I do think it’d be good for the two of you to collaborate.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Permission granted. In that case, Kurama-sama, I look forward to working with you.

  <div class="msr-narration">
  <p><i>Flashback end.</i></p>

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  I’ll leave mine for now, but I have to draft Azekawa-san’s outfit before tomorrow’s meeting.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  ……
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  So far, I’ve decided on a Tengu[^5] themed outfit for him. Movable parts like wings are cool as hell, and anyone can recognize a Tengu from a mile away.

  But how do I make this a total sweep…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Ah, Ushio… you’re here. I need to talk to you about the mahoCos event.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  What?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Chief was grumbling about your costume progress and all yesterday…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  And what exactly does that have to do with you? Well, whatever, don’t worry about it. I’m working on it just fine.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  I beg to differ. You just said you were putting off your own costume just now. Nanamegi, say something.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  What do you mean by that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  I’m not putting it off. I said I’ll think of something that matches the rest of you guys later.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  …Dude. Did you forget our goal for this event?

  We’re participating in this to promote HAMA Tours, Mister. Not to fulfill our own selfish desires.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  And I could say the same for <em>you</em>? Why did you decide on a Kappa exactly?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Wha–?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  There were tons of other themes you could have chosen. Why did you purposely decide on a lame-ass one, Mr. Panda?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Whe…ther it’s lame is subjective…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  The thing’s bald and smells like ass. And what exactly are you gonna do on the runway? Hold a cucumber and flail around? I think that's pretty damn lame if you ask me.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  S-Someone said it was c-cute…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Oh, who’s being selfish now? Don’t be a hypocrite.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Uu…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Great, glad we settled that. Why don’t you go back to class now?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  …O’ Nanamegi, I think you should leave for now. When Uu-chan gets like this, he stops listening to reason.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  …<i>(Sigh)</i>. So annoying.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  That being said, I find your decision to cosplay a Kappa quite innovative. I have heard that the real identities of the Kappa are actually gray aliens.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Huh? Gray…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  I am most excited to see how your Kappa cosplay will turn out.

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Um, everyone. Thanks for all the costume proposals. Nayuki-kun and I have looked them over and—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Everyone needs to redo theirs.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …….
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  You two can be so cruel.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Explanation requested.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  First off, Kurama-kun’s Oni[^6] design… this is just the default outfit. What exactly was your intention behind this?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  I planned on adding stuff based on how the other costumes looked since it’d look off if my design clashed against someone else’s.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  This can’t even be called a draft. The reason we called this meeting was to ensure that all of your designs complement each others’ as a group.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Now, now, Nayuki-kun. Ushio-kun is still a student, he’s not used to formal work practices.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  …You have a point. Please be more careful with such matters in the future.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  What a pain…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Moving on… For some reason, Hachinoya-kun’s design consists of his whole body being covered in wheels…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  I wanted to give off the image of a bold and stoic Wanyudo[^7].
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  And Nanamegi-kun's... is half Kappa… half UFO?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  U-Umm… I was told my idea was lame, so Muneuji gave me some advice…

  I-It’s…not really giving “innovative” is it… Ahaha…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  These designs are both very original, but… they’re a bit eccentric…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(The default outfits are a hundred times better than these flops…)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Lastly, Azekawa-kun’s Tengu outfit…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(This one’s gotta be the most legit outta all our current options… I’m confident.)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Kurama-sama assisted me greatly in the drafting process. The outfit consists of many glowing neon parts meant to elicit a flamboyant aura through stimulating the audience’s photopic vision.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  It certainly looks gorgeous, I’ll give you that. However, that is exactly why it’s unsatisfactory.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …What?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  It is far too flashy and stands out too much.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Is it bad to have him stand out?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  That’s not it. It doesn’t coordinate with the rest of the group’s—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Nayuki-san, are you perhaps taking the side of those people that mocked Azekawa-san back in mahorova?

  —That androids don’t deserve to stand on the main stage?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  !! Kurama-kun, how did you know about Azekawa-kun being—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Hm? Why are we suddenly talking about androids?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Oh… Um, well…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  You’re the evening group’s conductor, so of course you know his circumstances right? Is it okay for someone like you to have such a conservative mindset?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Hold on Ushio, calm down for a sec.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh… I get it now.

  Ushio. You designed a costume that <em>you</em> wanted to see on an android, didn’t you?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …What exactly do you—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Because this isn’t something that Azekawa Kinari himself wished for.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  ……!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Plüss isn’t the type to aggressively assert himself, so instead, you took the lead and came up with a design for him…

  But, you, at the very least, consulted him about it, no? About his preferences, likes and dislikes, what kind of outfit he wishes to wear, and so on…

  You would know those things if you were truly looking at him as himself, yes?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Kuguri. While it is true I neglected to provide information about myself on the matter, despite that, Kurama-sama still concocted 8 designs which he thought would suit me…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Tch… Azekawa-san, forget it.

  Speaking of which, everyone else's drafts got rejected as well, so why am I the only one getting flamed? If we’re just going to waste time like this, can we just end the meeting already?

  It’s all good as long as I fix up the designs, right? Then I’ll go do just that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Ushio-kun! Wait!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Ehhh…? He actually left like that, wow.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  …….
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Well, well. Handling a pubescent *fiú* is quite a difficult task.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  …Domeki-san. You’re not in any position to be nitpicking others.

  I’ll say that yours is not nearly as ridiculous as the others. However, this design… You’re basically naked. This is a cosplay, so can you at least put on some clothes?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Hm? Too stimulating for you, little guy?
