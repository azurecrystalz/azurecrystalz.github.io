  Such wise words. Nobody understands Reito like Sanseiu-sensei.

  No matter how many times I read it, it’s peak. It was worth taking the first train of the day to get to the venue. The cosplayer that was helping out at the booth was seriously skilled, too…

  I gotta grab something to drink and send my feedback through Wataame[^1].

  </div>

  ![everyoneshere](https://files.catbox.moe/oqiqq5.PNG)

  {% bubble Kafka %}
  Alright, everyone’s here.

  Now then, let’s begin today’s meeting.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Akuta %}
  Hell yea! It’s about time!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  I will explain the situation.

  We’ve called you all here today to discuss a collaboration between companies.

  We’ve been asked to participate in “mahorova CosFest vol.1”, also known as “mahoCos” for short. It is a full-dive cosplay event that will take place inside of mahorova.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Chihiro %}
  Ehh, a collab with THE mahorova!?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Renga %}
  That’s a crazy huge deal…!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Indeed. The primary objective of mahoCos is to promote the re-release of a costume app that users can set as avatars inside mahorova.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kafka %}
  HAMA’s been the talk of the town as of late ♪

  Therefore, we want you, as the acting ward mayors, to participate in this event and liven things up.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![theme](https://files.catbox.moe/uqbvgc.PNG)

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  The theme of the event is “Ayakashi [^3]”.

  In order to implement the costumes into the app, we’d like you to prepare designs based on that theme.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …

  <th><i>(I’m interested in cosplaying in mahorova, but… That theme is <b>so</b> boring. There’s gotta be <b>something</b> more interesting they can do, right?)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Raito %}
  Nayuki, have the participating mayors or any potential candidates already been decided?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  …I feel as though somebody just asked about the participants. Here is what we have as of right now.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  …N-Nayuki-kun didn’t acknowledge Raito-san at all…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  The event administration has extended an offer to Domeki-san.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Hm? Me?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Much to my delight, it seems that someone among the management is a big fan of Ev3ns.

  They’re especially fond of Domeki-san, so they were really hoping that he would participate.

  Furthermore, Domeki-san’s disposition suits the “Ayakashi” theme quite well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(Haah? What the hell. What kind of cheap abuse of power is this?)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  ![pooks](https://files.catbox.moe/xeuui0.PNG)

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Fufu… It's not like I can help it if that little lamb has such fine taste.

  Alright, I’ll do it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Thank you. Next, I’d like to request someone myself.

  Azekawa-kun, I would like to nominate you as a participant.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Command processed.

  Manager, please provide an explanation for your appeal to assist in decision-making.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  This request also involves reviews of the costume app.

  Thus, I would like you to serve as a record-keeper for the participants’ opinions as well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Master. May I accept this order?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Of course you can!

  Kinari-kun’s specialty is collecting data, after all!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Understood. Command processed.

  Updating priority queue.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Alright, then we’ve decided on two participants.

  If anyone else is interested, please let us know.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![kugunii](https://files.catbox.moe/llvafu.PNG)

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Ah, if Kugunii… If Doumeki-san is going to be there, I think I’d like to join too.

  I’d like to try working with him.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh? How cute of you, Nanaki.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(Ughhh. Those relatives sure are buddy-buddy.)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Then Nanaki-kun will be joining as well. Anyone else?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Oh, right, cosplay is Sakujiro-san’s specialty!

  If he can advise us regarding the costumes—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Sakujiro %}
  I’m terribly sorry, but my schedule is packed full.

  I have not a moment of rest until the day of the event. I fear it will be quite the challenge to provide my expertise this time around.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  I see… In that case, the rest of us will just have to do our best.

  Ayakashi is a really interesting theme…!

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …I don’t think so at all.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Eh?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Isn’t it a bit too spontaneous to throw in Domeki-san just because he happens to look the part?

  To start with, Ayakashi is all about yokai, right? That’s pretty basic for a cosplay theme.

  You really wanna use that outdated theme for an app’s PR? Isn’t it missing something fresh and innovative?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Um… I… guess so?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  …Fufu.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![funny](https://files.catbox.moe/wtsipf.PNG)

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …What’s so funny, Domeki-san?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh, nothing. I was just wondering what the problem would be with something "basic".

  Isn’t figuring out how to play around with such an everyday theme the fun part?

  Or is that level of creativity a little too challenging for you?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  That’s not what I’m saying.

  <th><i>(I’m no Karigane-san, but I’m by no means a stranger to cosplay.)</i></th>

  Just… from what you guys were saying earlier, this is an insane offer, but is it really okay to be so nonchalant about this whole thing?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  *(Sigh)*... You really can’t get enough of complaining about every little thing, can you.

  Just yesterday, wasn’t it you who said “It’s like there’s people who don’t know the basics of communication”?

  Bio Avatar… An abbreviated name for Biometric Scan Avatars, created by utilizing data from real-world body scans to achieve an avatar that closely resembles the user’s real-world appearance.

  I see… The other people around here definitely don’t look like sea creatures. I won’t have to worry about being crushed by a yokozuna slickhead.

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Even *I’ve* seen all of the people here before.

  So we really were invited to such a high-profile event…

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Apologies for the delay. The briefing session ran a bit long.

  It seems you all managed to login with the Bio Avatars just fine. Have you had the chance to try out the costume app?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Ah, Nayuki-kun. We were just about to do that.

  There’s tons of default costumes in here, but you can also make your own designs….

  You really can create a completely personalized cosplay with this.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Indeed. The system is also quite simple to use.

  That being said… There’s one thing the president wants you to be aware of.

  On the day of the event, the team selected by the judges will win the privilege of having their designs displayed in the heart of mahorova for one week.

  This is a perfect opportunity to promote HAMA Tours, so he’s hoping that the five of you will go for the prize.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![woofwoof](https://files.catbox.moe/o8bo9q.PNG)

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Well then… I'll go for this serpent outfit. It's a bit on the revealing side. Reptiles and I are quite compatible creatures, you know.

  Nagi, what do you think? Isn’t it a perfect fit for me?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  It certainly is revealing… That’s a lot of skin showing.

  It looks like it’d get chilly, and besides, it’s geared towards professional cosplayers.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  And? There's nothing wrong with shedding a few layers.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  That'll just make it even colder... but I guess that's the cost of being stylish.

  A bold yet stoic choice, as expected of you, Kuguri-san. I’ll have to take a page out of your book.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Look, Nanaki-kun. Isn’t this Kappa costume cute?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  I have no particular preference.

  I will leave the choice to Master's discretion.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIA %}
  Pfffft. Did you hear that? “Master’s discretion,” he said.

  Are there really such boring, mannequin-like people at this event?

  They don’t seem to be anyone noteworthy, unlike us.

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble AIB %}
  Oh, did you catch the film show last Friday? The one with the android in the supporting role. Doesn’t he remind you of it?

  That android’s facial expressions were horrendous~ The fact that it didn’t look alive was a toootal turn off~

  Well, at least the foil character was pretty good.

  ……

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  So far, I’ve decided on a Tengu[^5] themed outfit for him. Movable parts like wings are cool as hell, and anyone can recognize a Tengu from a mile away.

  But how do I make this a total sweep…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Ah, Ushio… you’re here. I need to talk to you about the mahoCos event.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  What?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Chief was grumbling about your costume progress and all yesterday…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  And what exactly does that have to do with you? Well, whatever, don’t worry about it. I’m working on it just fine.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  I beg to differ. You just said you were putting off your own costume just now. Nanamegi, say something.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![nanaaaaki](https://files.catbox.moe/s4o1i3.PNG)

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  What do you mean by that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  I’m not putting it off. I said I’ll think of something that matches the rest of you guys later.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  …Dude. Did you forget our goal for this event?

  We’re participating in this to promote HAMA Tours, Mister. Not to fulfill our own selfish desires.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  And I could say the same for <em>you</em>? Why did you decide on a Kappa exactly?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Wha–?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  There were tons of other themes you could have chosen. Why did you purposely decide on a lame-ass one, Mr. Panda?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Whe…ther it’s lame is subjective…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  The thing’s bald and smells like ass. And what exactly are you gonna do on the runway? Hold a cucumber[^6] and flail around? I think that's pretty damn lame if you ask me.

  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Muneuji %}
  That being said, I find your decision to cosplay a Kappa quite innovative. I have heard that the real identities of the Kappa are actually gray aliens.

  You two can be so cruel.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Explanation requested.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  First off, Kurama-kun’s Oni[^7] design… this is just the default outfit. What exactly was your intention behind this?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  I planned on adding stuff based on how the other costumes looked since it’d look off if my design clashed against someone else’s.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  This can’t even be called a draft. The reason we called this meeting was to ensure that all of your designs complement each other's as a group.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Now, now, Nayuki-kun. Ushio-kun is still a student, he’s not used to formal work practices.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  …You have a point. Please be more careful with such matters in the future.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  What a pain…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Moving on… For some reason, Hachinoya-kun’s design consists of his whole body being covered in wheels…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  I wanted to give off the image of a bold and stoic Wanyudo[^8].
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  And Nanamegi-kun's... is half Kappa… half UFO?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  U-Umm… I was told my idea was lame, so Muneuji gave me some advice…
  {% endbubble %}

  ![innovative](https://files.catbox.moe/pg7et2.PNG)

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  I-It’s…not really giving “innovative” is it… Ahaha…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  These designs are both very original, but… they’re a bit eccentric…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(The default outfits are a hundred times better than these flops…)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Lastly, Azekawa-kun’s Tengu outfit…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  <th><i>(This one’s gotta be the most legit outta all our current options… I’m confident.)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Kurama-sama assisted me greatly in the drafting process. The outfit consists of many glowing neon parts meant to elicit a flamboyant aura through stimulating the audience’s photopic vision.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  It certainly looks gorgeous, I’ll give you that. However, that is exactly why it’s unsatisfactory.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …What?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  It is far too flashy and stands out too much.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![stand](https://files.catbox.moe/zygsyj.PNG)

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Is it bad to have him stand out?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  That’s not it. It doesn’t coordinate with the rest of the group’s—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Nayuki-san, are you perhaps taking the side of those people that mocked Azekawa-san back in mahorova?

  —That androids don’t deserve to stand on the main stage?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  !! Kurama-kun, how did you know about Azekawa-kun being—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Hm? Why are we suddenly talking about androids?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kaede %}
  Oh… Um, well…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  You’re the Evening Team's conductor, so of course you know his circumstances right? Is it okay for someone like you to have such a conservative mindset?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Hold on Ushio, calm down for a sec.

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh… I get it now.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![MANNNN](https://files.catbox.moe/2blw33.PNG)

  Ushio. You designed a costume that <em>you</em> wanted to see on an android, didn’t you?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …What exactly do you—
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Because this isn’t something that Azekawa Kinari himself wished for.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  ……!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Plüss isn’t the type to aggressively assert himself, so instead, you took the lead and came up with a design for him…

  But, you, at the very least, consulted him about it, no? About his preferences, likes and dislikes, what kind of outfit he wishes to wear, and so on…

  You would know those things if you were truly looking at him as himself, yes?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Kuguri. While it is true I neglected to provide information about myself on the matter, despite that, Kurama-sama still concocted 8 designs which he thought would suit me…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Tch… Azekawa-san, forget it.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![flamed](https://files.catbox.moe/rlf20z.PNG)

  Speaking of which, everyone else's drafts got rejected as well, so why am I the only one getting flamed? If we’re just going to waste time like this, can we just end the meeting already?

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Ushio, you came. Thank you.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Hachinoya-san… and Azekawa-san…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  I learned about Kinari’s “circumstances” from the chief yesterday.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  I was surprised… but then again we have aliens, so I guess it’s not really weird for there to be all sorts of people out there.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Aliens? …Are you talking about Muneuji’s helmet?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Ah, no… Don't worry about it.

  Anyways, I get why you got mad at Nayuki-san during the meeting. But I thought you should maybe try discussing things with Kinari first.

  Sorry if I’m being meddlesome.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  You’re not…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Kurama-sama. I apologize for my shortcomings.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![didn'tdo](https://files.catbox.moe/gs70xl.PNG)

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …Azekawa-san, you didn’t do anything wrong.

  —The thing is, I've spent more of my life around robots than humans, so I kinda can’t deal with people who don’t see them as equals and such…

  There are narrow-minded people who see machines as just objects… but I don’t think that’s true. I can’t see robots like that. I just don’t understand it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  …I think I get what you mean. It’s like how Sonia is family to me.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  That’s why I… overreacted to Nayuki-san’s words and suddenly left like that… I ended up showing you guys that… unsightly side of myself.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Not at all. You allocated a big portion of your time for my sake.

  I would like to interpret this as Kurama-sama’s own form of hospitality. I am ever so grateful for your actions.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  My… hospitality…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  However, it was true that I allowed Kurama-sama to take care of all matters concerning the outfit, despite the fact that Master specifically instructed the two of us to collaborate.

  I believe we should work together to come up with revisions this time around—what are your thoughts?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …! Of course. Please, let me redeem myself.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  …Ah, while we’re on the topic, could I ask for some help on my Wanyudo design as well? After some thought, I feel like there still aren't enough wheels.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …I don’t mean to be rude or anything, but I don't think that’s the problem.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  In that case, may I propose that we invite Kuguri and Nanamegi-sama to discuss as well?

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  <em>(Sigh)</em>… Everyone, please revise them within 3 days. Also—

  I failed to say this earlier, but… there is no sense of coordination as a group whatsoever in everyone’s designs.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  You mean… the fact that there are no shared motifs?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nayuki %}
  Exactly. Please base your revisions around complementing each other’s designs, and please adhere to the deadline.
  {% endbubble %}

  <div class="msr-narration">

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Oh yeah. Shared motifs…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  If there are no problems, may I contact the other two?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  …No, I’ll tell them myself when I get back to the dorms. Though it might be kinda ironic since I’m the one that left mid-meeting.

  <th><i>(Which is why—)</i></th>

  …I feel like I need to be more transparent with them.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Understood. In that case, I shall book a conference room.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Okay, then to end our discussion…

  Shall we shout out our resolutions for the event?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Why??
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Because from now on, it’s the real deal. I heard that high schoolers do this sometimes to refresh themselves—shouting from the rooftop, I mean.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Um, and where exactly did you hear that from? Don’t tell me, you’re gonna make us do what Idiotake did during his Hospitality Tour?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Hm? Akuta’s Hospitality Tour?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Day2’s tour information is not inputted in my database. I came across the idea while sifting through communal broadcast records from the past and proposed it to Hachinoya-sama.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Eh… Ah, I see…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  This is the essence of what they call ‘youth’. I'm sure HAMA Tours’s rooftop was also specifically made for this.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Yeah, definitely not…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Now then, don’t be shy.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  That’s… easier said than done…

  How was that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Mm. A nice shout.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Um, this isn’t really the time to be shouting “tamaya,” though…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Apologies. It seems an address error occurred during the data fetching process. Data fetching logic needs refactoring.

  Kurama-sama. Can you provide me with an example of a correct shout?
  {% endbubble %}

  Perfect timing.

  Kugunii and I were just talking about how we can fix up the designs.

  I wanted to talk about it with everyone.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Oh…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Looks like you were thinking the same thing. That certainly speeds things along.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  You’re not mad…?

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Mad? …Oh, about the meeting?

  Actually, I’m more happy I got to see a cuter side of you.

  Kugunii’s so mature. It looked like a tantrum to me.

  <th><i>(Keep it together, me… Remember the promise I made on the roof…)</i></th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  But… I felt that scrapping the Tengu design you came up with would be a waste.

  Especially all the neon bits… They might not directly connect with the Ayakashi theme, but we can still try to use them.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  If adding it to only Plüss’s outfit is too over the top and makes him stick out in a bad way, we should just add it to everyone’s outfits.

  Oh wait, it looks like he had something else to say. Go ahead.

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  G-Gghh…!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  And your idea?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Oh… right.  I was thinking of adding neon parts to everyone’s Ayakashi costumes, but…

  Thinking about where we’re gonna cosplay is important too.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Is it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  Th-That’s just what it said online… so…

  If we're making all of our outfits match, then we should make it match the event venue too.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  That’s not a bad idea… Could we do something like that?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Sending an inquiry to mahoCos management through their established contact page…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  So fast…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Awaiting response… awaiting response… awaiting response…
  {% endbubble %}

  ![response](https://files.catbox.moe/nwotsg.PNG)

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Response received.

  There would be no issue with additions made to the program.

  Awaiting command to implement changes.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  I see. It’s doable since it’s in mahorova. Then, Kinari can handle all the technical stuff.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Oh, and I had an idea too…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Is it turning us into UFOs from the legs down?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Stooop, it isn’t.

  How about some music to go along with our show? I don’t mind writing it.
  
  I can probably manage to throw together a track that loops by the time we need it.

  Unless… having Kugunii to help me out would make me pretty happy.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  If someone as spoiled as you is asking, then I don’t have much of a choice.

  I’ll lend a hand, though pop music isn’t quite my forte.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Oh… I had something I wanted to ask you all too.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
  Oh? Do say?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  What’s the ideal number of wheels to put on a Wanyudo?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  You’re so fixated on wheels…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nagi %}
  Yeah. The whole reason why I like motorcycles and wanted to cosplay as a Wanyudo was because I like wheels.

  I thought… that I should probably focus more on the wheels.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kinari %}
  Understood. Updating the “Skills and Hobbies” section of database.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Apart from me becoming a Kappa UFO… it’d be fine to keep all the other ideas.

  Being cohesive is important when it comes to making a concept album, but that doesn’t mean everything has to be the same.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![nananskfakjf](https://files.catbox.moe/2bwvn7.PNG)

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  While we worked through all of these, the only things that couldn’t be scrapped at the end of it all are the things that make each of us shine.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  ! Th-That line. It’s… Sanseiu’s…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Nanaki %}
  Sanseiu?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Ushio %}
  F-Forget about it.
