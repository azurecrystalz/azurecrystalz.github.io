  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —"Werewolf"?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Thaaaat's right. It's a game where you gotta pick out the lying wereworlf among your friends by talking to them.<sup>[1]</sup>

    A bunch of guys over at Seisou Hall's common room were playing it a while back and I went ahead and joined, it was pretty fun.

    Actually I think we should all play it since we're all here! Loser's gotta pay for lunch!

    First thing I'm gonna do if I'm the werewolf is you, Niki. Better brace yourself, gyahaha~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Quit making those scary threats! I may love eating, but I would *not* like to be eaten!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    I've played Werewolf online before. It needs eight people to play though, so we can't really play it ourselves, can we? 
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Don't worry about it. I'll text everyone from "ASOBI" on Holdhands and we'll have a full team reaaal quick.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Easy for *you* to say. Not everyone has free time the way you do, Rinne-kun.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Aan? Just what're you talking about? I'm a pretty busy guy too. Busy making the most out of my life that is!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That's the point of free time.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![leaving](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1107908793259524108/1126371117100183573/IMG_6444.png?width=1822&height=842)

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Ah...HiMERU-han, are you already leaving?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Yes. Since discussion about work is already finished, staying any more is pointless.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Fair enough. Before you go though, can I ask you something?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —A question? If HiMERU can answer it, then please ask.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Thanks. I don't really know how to say this so I'll just spit it out. HiMERU-han, did you do something wrong?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Did HiMERU...do something?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku %}
    Well, it's not like I think you're guilty, HiMERU-han.

    Buuuut yesterday Anzu-han asked me to tell her everything I could about you.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki %}
    Ah, she asked me about HiMERU-kun too, but it wasn't yesterday.

    I was pretty hungry at the time so I said no and "later", but I can't help but wonder why she was asking?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Oukawa and Shiina were both asked about it? Then that means...
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Duh, she asked me too. I said I'd tell only if she won a bet, but then she ran away quick.

    Merumeru, just *what* did you do?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ......
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    If you won't tell, why don't we find out through a game of Werewolf? Gyahaha~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —There's nothing to find out. HiMERU doesn't know what brought this on.

    <th>*(If there **was** something, it's likely "my" secret. Could she be suspicious? So she tried asking around...?)*</th>

    HiMERU will find Anzu-san and personally ask her what it is she'd like to know. Now then...
  {% endbubble %}

  ![person](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1107908793259524108/1126371117465084044/IMG_6462.png?width=1822&height=842)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(That person with their back turned...just as expected, that's Anzu-san. HiMERU finally found her.)*</th>

    <th>*(She's still here at COSPRO's office, so maybe she's looking for info on HiMERU?)*</th>

    <th>*(Then HiMERU will do some looking of his own. What are your true intentions—)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Hello, Anzu-san. Are you here at COSPRO for work?

    You're looking at the computer screen so intently...oya.

    Those are...videos of HiMERU's past lives, correct? How nostalgic.

    But, DVDs having this footage aren't in circulation anymore. Why do you have it?

    ...So that's why. You're borrowing them from Vice President Saegusa. He *would* have this kind of information.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(So rather than "Crazy:B"'s lives, she's looking at "HiMERU"'s solo lives? So she really **is** looking for information on HiMERU?)*</th>

    <th>*(But, why...)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  ![embarassing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1107908793259524108/1126519762516725840/IMG_6472.png)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Fufu. Even though these are all past lives, it's a bit embarassing to be stared at so intently.

    Why are you deciding to watch them now?

    "Personalized Outfits"...Yes, HiMERU has heard of them. Could you be planning to make one for HiMERU?

    So that's how it is. You decided to start doing more research on idols beforehand after working on the Vice President's "Personalized Outfit", correct?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(Come to think of it, the Vice President's "Personalized Outfit" really **did** seem to suit him. But it's not like HiMERU knows him well anyway...)*</th>

    <th>*(At any rate, it seems she wasn't trying to find out any secrets.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Anzu-san, could you be asking around for informations in order to design HiMERU's "Personalized Outfit"?

    So that's why. Just a while ago, Amagi and the others had said that you were "asking about" HiMERU.

    Fumu...at first you were going to talk to HiMERU, but he'd left sooner so you talked to them instead?

    So that's what happened, HiMERU understands now. Well, HiMERU *has* been leaving sooner lately, so our schedules may not have aligned, Anzu-san.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    <th>*(Still, for Amagi to use a words like "done something"...it made HiMERU needlessly cautious.)*</th>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    You're sorry for seeming intrusive, you say? No, you really don't need to apologize.

    ...You'd like to hear HiMERU's requests? And what type of outfit he'd like to wear?

    Please don't worry about that, Anzu-san, make it the way you see fit—

    No matter what it is you come up with, HiMERU will happily wear it. By all means, design it freely.

    —What's wrong? Is there something else you want to ask?

    You're going to take your ideas home and think of a draft, then discuss it with HiMERU later...

    Alright. You're free to do so anytime, Anzu-san.
