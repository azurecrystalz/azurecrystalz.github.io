Line up straight! The name’s Kodama. I'm the chief warden and instructor around here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
I’m gonna be the one <i>kiiiindly</i> getting you around! You’d better get this face memorized!

Starting today, your names are your tag numbers. When you’re called, you respond with respect!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tao %}
(Tag numbers? Oh… The numbers on our uniforms. Mine’s… 500010.)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Listen up, you scumbags. Those tags of yours have got biometric tech in ‘em.

The guards will know <i>everything</i>, from where you are to what you’re doing.

Don’t stupidly try to take them off, or else you’ll set off an alarm.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Don’t think about escaping either. If any of you touch those big, <i>ginormous</i> walls, system headquarters will get a message telling them who did it.

And obviously your chances of even getting on a boat are <i>zero!</i>

Because you’ll be locked out before you even board it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble InmateA %}
Tsk, if a ship won’t do then there’s always the ocean…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
And don’t even <i>think</i> about trying to swim away!

We’ve released a bunch of man-eating sharks into the waters.

The second you dip your toes in, you’re toast! Hahaha!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tao %}
<th><i>(So that’s how it is… Looks like breaking out really is impossible…)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Buuut, who knows?

If you’re good, then you might get something nice during playtime.

That all depends on the amount of effort you put in, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Now then!

I, the kind Chief Warden-sama, will answer just one question for you lot!

Alright, No. 500017! If you’ve got something to say, spit it out!

Huh? What are you on about?

Well, if you don’t have any questions, then fine.

Get into your groups and head to your quarters! Dismissed!

Theft…

Kitakata Raito.

…According to collected data, he is presently the leader of the most powerful faction on this island prison.

Also the founder of a metaverse community, an entrepreneur, and an investor. Ranked among the top in JPN’s “Most Desirable Lover” list for nine consecutive years.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Oh? You’re pretty informed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble 500017 %}
Biometric scan results indicate that he is one hundred and eighty-two centimeters in height. His weight is–
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tao %}
H-hey! Bringing that up is rude!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Ahaha! You newcomers are rather funny.

As Number 17 said, I’m forming a group… or, rather, a gang in this prison.

There are other gangs too, but you would be better off joining one if you want to protect yourselves from people like the ones you just clashed with. If you wanted to join mine, I’d gladly welcome you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tao %}
Gangs…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Right. Mine is the strongest, but there’s another one that rivals it.

I wouldn’t recommend that one though… Their leader is a bit difficult to deal with.

Number 10-kun, Number 17-kun. From what I’ve seen, you’re both model prisoners. So you two probably wouldn’t see eye to eye with him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble 500017 %}
Invitation to faction declined.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble 500017 %}
A command system has already been implemented by the guards.

<th><i>(Huh? Is Nayuki-kun mad? There’s no way… Someone as calm as him could never get angry.)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
…Well, I can understand the president’s perspective on it.

The areas we’d be responsible for, Wards 10 to 14, don’t have many tourist attractions. What they do have are lots of famous venues. Not taking advantage of them would be a waste.

The problem is, unlike the previous groups, the wardens wouldn’t just be singing, they’d be participating in idol activities too. There’s going to be risks that come up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Risks?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
Simply put, scandals. The biggest obstacle would be maintaining a reputation. All it would take is one scandal, and everything would fall apart.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kafka %}
That’s Nayuki for you. Seems like you have a good understanding of things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yachiyo %}
P-Personally, as an idol fan… I don’t know how I feel about idols quitting after just one scandal…

When I think about how many idols have disappeared that way…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sakujiro %}
Fuefuki-kun. Your nose is running, allow me to wipe it for you. There, there.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kafka %}
To make sure passionate fans like Yachiyo don’t get hurt, reputation management is our biggest priority.

Which is why this time I’m going to use a bit of an unconventional approach when forming this idol group.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
…? An unconventional approach?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kafka %}
What if we picked idols that are already hated? That way, it’s only up from there.

Wouldn't it be nice to have idols who show off their flaws and captivate others with their way of life?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
It’s quite the gamble, to be honest. It’s risky, there’s too much guessing involved.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kafka %}
Well then… Should we make a bet?

This is a gamble I think I can win.

Don’t you worry. This is all according to the 0th Ward Mayor’s plans.

Both of you come with me to a separate room. You’re about to see a <i>veeery</i> special audition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
A special audition…?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
I’ll tell you what! Kodama here has his own take on idols!

Yeeeesss… The idol industry is <i>truly</i> a world of survival of the fittest… where only the <i>strongest</i> survive!

Luck, wits, and skill! These are all the qualities every idol should have!

<i>Aaaand <b>that</b> is why!</i> We’ll be having a <i>Survival Audition</i> right here, right now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
<th><i>(Huh? <b>Huuuh?!</b> A Survival Audition…?! What does <b>that</b> mean?!)</i></th>

{% bubble Momiji %}
This is… incredible! All of this is footage of the island?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Exactly. There was a time where escape attempts from convicts were constant, so we installed cameras at all 300 posts on the island.

The footage changes every time a biological response is detected.

In other words! You can watch the <i>entire</i> audition right here from the comfort of this room…!

For an idol survival program, this is the best seat in the house!

Of course, this all comes with assorted color penlights that we’ve prepared right here for when you’ve found your favorite. We also have uchiwas[^8] that can be made with just the press of a button!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
R-Right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
<th><i>(Sounds like Kodama-san really loves idols… He’d probably get along well with Yachiyo-kun…)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
So… Could you give us more information about this audition?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Certainly. The prisoners will be using this while participating in the survival game.
{% endbubble %}

![gun](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwjkkl8hy/image/upload/v1721064716/mainsto/ch5/demo.png)

{% bubble Momiji %}
This is… a digital paint gun, right? Like the kind that’s used in airsoft games and shoots some kind of special ink.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
The guards on this island carry them on a day by day basis. The special ink sticks onto the prisoners’ uniforms, activating an anti-escape mechanism that paralyzes them.

In this instance, the prisoners will also be using them the same way. Upon being shot, the ink will paralyze the opponent.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
So they will be trying to take each other down?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Precisely. We’ll release the prisoners onto the island, and the five who survive until the end of this all out battle-royale… will become idols!!

And there you have it! The Idol <i>Survival Game!!!</i>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}

10 are remaining.

All of them are headed towards the center area.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
Tsk… So he managed to live...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Um, from the looks of the monitor… It looks like there are three pairs and one trio.

That leaves just one… Hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
<th><i>(Wait a sec. That person with the black haired guy, wasn’t I just on a plane with him not too long ago [^11]?!)</i></th>

<th><i>(I thought he was giving off some strange vibes… but I had no idea he was serving time here!)</i></th>

<th><i>(Also… the blonde in that team there. He’s pretty attractive, but he looks familiar…)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Nayuki-kun. Is that person with blonde hair… a celeb?

I get the feeling I’ve seen him somewhere before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nayuki %}
I think that’s just your imagination.

He’s a criminal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
<th><i>(Huh? Wh-What?!)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
I <i>knew</i> it! We all believed in you, Chiiiii!

As expected of a true idol!

Good luck! Great luck, even! The best luck of all time!

Next, Chihiro will say “I’m fashionably late to the party, my bad☆” !!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Ummmm… Ko-Kodama-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Augh! I-It’s not what you think!!!

I wasn’t worried about Chii because he hadn’t shown up on screen for a while or anything!!!

He’s just meant to be an idol!!

I’m not biased or anything… but still! It’s good that… he made it this far!

{% bubble Kinari %}
Kitakata Raito.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kinari %}
It seems you have been double-crossed.

You are surprisingly disliked, Kitakata Raito.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Didn’t I say so already? Our opponent is like the Jack in Euchre.

He’s the only one that can turn the tables, no matter how strong our hand is.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="announcement">

{% bubble Kuguri %}
Hey there, King. It’s a shame you don’t look as desperate as I thought you would.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Kuguri. Seems like you’ve done quite a lot of scheming.

Did you get information beforehand from the guards?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuguri %}
Hm, did I?

Anyway… I can finally show you what despair really is… ♪

Well done, you lot!

Let me explain what the special prison activity is!

{% bubble Momiji %}
U-Um! It’s nice to meet you!

I’m the chief of HAMA Tours, a travel agency.

I’m actually here to recruit you all…

To come to HAMA and become Ward Mayors, as well as the next local idol group!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tao %}
H-Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Idols? Ward Mayors?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Y-yes. This might sound crazy, but the Survival Game was the audition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
Rejoice, you lot!

By becoming idols, you get parole and less time on your sentence!

Obviously, we’ll have to implant a microchip in you to keep you from escaping!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tao %}
A microchip…

Nevermind how they’re forgetting human rights, that’s just terrifying.

I am! I’m jazzed～☆

<th><i>(This idea really might be impossible after all?! Nobody really seems thrilled about this… What do I do with this atmosphere...)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Hm. I see. Come to think of it, today is Tenshanichi[^13] isn’t it?

The revolutionary planet, Neptune, and the planet of love, Venus are aligned. Is that what’s happening?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
<th><i>(Wh-What?! He suddenly started talking about astrology?!)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Got it. Idols, right? Sounds fun.

Let’s do that next.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Ummm… Raito-san?

Are you saying you’re okay with it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raito %}
Precisely. The five of us forming a unit sounds like it’d be fun.

If it's possible, you should let me be the leader.

I’m good at leading groups.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuguri %}
Oh really? Says the Naked King.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
R-Really?!

<th><i>(I’m a little worried, but the fact that he’s logical and willing to take initiative is reassuring!)</i></th>

Just wait a moment, I’ll ask the president!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kodama %}
<th><i>(Hmmm…)</i></th>

<th><i>(Well, it’s not the same as the leader… but Chii will definitely be the center.)</i></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
I got the greenlight! Raito-san will be the leader, and the president wants you to come up with a unit name with a 3 in it!

{% bubble Raito %}
Roger. I’ll give it some thought.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Momiji %}
Um… by the way, Nayuki-kun here is your manager.

{% bubble Kuguri %}
Hmm…?

We met on the plane not long ago. Could this be fate?
{% endbubble %}

!!!

So you remembered me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuguri %}
I’ve got a good memory, <i>cicám [^14]</i>.

Idols, huh… I see how it is.
