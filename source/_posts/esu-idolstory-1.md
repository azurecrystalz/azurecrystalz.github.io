> Esu uses a bit of onomatopoeias in the beginning and normally I would type them out as is so that you could see the quirky bits in action but just for this story I’ll translate them here and any text <th>like this in purple</th> marks his use of an onomatopoeia!

{% bubble Esu %}
Now, let’s get this adventure started!!!!

Today’s adventure issss…<th>drum rooooooll~!</th>

To close my eyes, pick a drink from the console, and drink whatever random concoction comes out!

The adventure is a go! <th>Go! Go! <i>Go!</i></th>

Keep the adventure going! <th>Glug glug glug glug~</th>

Ugh! Adventure☆Failed….!!!!

…Hm. Well actually, maybe not. Sure, I did drink something that was so bad my tongue and stomach are killing me, buuuut that doesn’t mean it was <i>totally</i> a failure.

Something like this will definitely help me get stronger <i>and</i> more awesome!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
How do you like <i>them</i> apples? Whaddya think of <i>that</i>, Onee-san?

Eh? It’s a bit of a sudden question?

Riiiiiiight~! I think so too! I’ve been thinking that this whole time! I’ve been thinking that since the age of the <i>dinosaurs</i> actually! Hiyahahahaha!

Ah! Wait, please! Don’t walk away?! Don’t look at me like I’m weird either, I’m sorry!

I drank something with a bunch of chemicals in it so my brain was all in a twist!

Quit calling for security, please! I’ll really be in trouble then! Would a dogeza<sup>**(1)**</sup> work? Would it make you feel better if I begged you on my knees?! Craaaaaap!

But wait! I’m supposed to be the man who will rule all mankind…! I never bow down to anyone–

{% bubble Esu %}
Argh~! Fine, fine! I’m sorry! I begged on my knees! Happy now?!

Jeez! You’re so spoiled! Like a spoiled little princess!

Oh right, wasn’t there a showing like that? Around five years ago<sup>**(2)**</sup>?

My freeloader roomie kept yapping with complaints like “oh the princess isn’t well portrayed” while watching the show all the time!

If you’re gonna keep griping about it so much, then why dontcha just stop watching it! Don’t you think so? ‘Cuz I think so! Actually, I was the first person in all of mankind to think so!!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
Hm? Who am I, you’re asking? We’ve never met before, you think…?

I’m Sagiri Esu! I’m gonna be the man that climbs to the top of the idol industry!

The higher the mountain, the better the climb! Isn’t that right, Onee-san?

Not really, you say…Well, that makes the score even then. Esu: 1 point, Onee-san: 1 point.

This is getting super excitinnnnnggg~! Hiyahahahaha!

Ah, stop it! Don’t get so scared! Don’t call security again!

Didn’t I already beg you not to do that earlier? Cut me some slack, will you?! Would money work? Do you need money?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
Eh, you think I’m super energetic? Well, that is my selling point!

When we’re talking about staying healthy, us Sagiri’s have been experts at that since my ol’ grandpappy was around. That was all thanks to the power of Sagiri Pharmaceuticals!

What’s Sagiri Pharmaceuticals? Where’d that come from? Onee-san, do you have any idea?

By the way, who’re you, Onee-san? Hm, Anzu-san the “Producer” huh…

Sorry, never heard of that name before!

After all, this is the first time we’ve met! I’ve got a special talent that lets me memorize the names and faces of everyone I’ve met on the first try!

Oh, and I’m also good at mountain climbing and setting up campsites. Barbeques too!

Speaking of the outdoors, Japan’s top player ☆ for the Camping Competition will be me, Sagiri Esu!

{% bubble Esu %}
Eh, you think everything I’m saying is so exaggerated it's funny?

Go big or go home! You’d be excited too if you saw something as big as mountains, oceans, forests, and even the heavens, right?

But small things have their charms too, right? I can’t say no to that! I never reject anything. I shoot for the stars and then swallow everything up!

Buuuut, if I stick to that kind of comparison then wouldn’t I be a black hole instead of the sun? Don’t black holes have bad associations with them too?

No, that’s just an assumption! I, Sagiri Esu, messed up! Should I feel bad for every black hole in the universe now?!

Nope, don’t think so! End of story!!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
…Hm? Do you have something you wanna say, Onee-san?

Right. Then I’ll be quiet. I won’t be able to hear you if I keep making a racket.

Not to worry, I’m pretty well known for being calm when I’m quiet.

……….

Mhm. Mhm. Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm!

Eh? “Be quiet”?! Was that not what I was doing? You don’t sound like it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
If I repent, get down on my knees, and pay money, will you be happy then?!

Ohhhh, right right. Onee-san, were you here to pick me up?

It’s because a bigger “producer” is calling me back for a chance to “audition”?

Right, right! That’s the whole reason why I showed up at ES.

I was so caught up in trying to get away from Fuyume and the fact that I hadn’t gone on an adventure today that I completely forgot about that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Esu %}
‘Kay. Then, let’s go. Wait, where exactly are we going?!

If you don’t tell me, then I’m just gonna end up spending each and every one of the days I have left in my life crossing out all the options!

The conference room? Roger! Thanks for going through the trouble to tell me!!!!

Ah, yelling so much made me thirsty.

<th>Glug glug glug glug glug…</th>

Hey, this drink is actually tasty now that I’ve tried it again.

–Meaning, today’s adventure was a success!

<h4>Translation Footnotes</h4>

**(1):** A japanese body language gesture one would use when trying to beg for something; In which a person gets on their knees and presses their head to the ground.
**(2):** Might be reaching but I think this could be referencing either “Rosicrucian” or “Cinderella Show” (Basic era Tomoya centric stories), I’m only hesitant since I can’t particularly remember if those were theater performances or televised programs (or both). If anyone has any insight do feel free to let me know.

**TL Notes:** Couple of things! Firstly, since the story is voiced, I tried to match his attitude/tone and express it as much as possible through writing so that you can get a feel for his character. Additionally, after discussing it with Mika, I feel like it’s worth mentioning that Esu's speech is Interesting. Namely, the way he phrases things is strange and, in my point of view, a bit convoluted in a really fun way. It could tie back to how he talks about how he’s bad at communicating in his second idol story.
