                Wanting to talk to him about his personalized outfit, Anzu approaches Rinne to brainstorm. Rinne, however, thinks that the best way to get to know someone is to go on a date. With nothing left to lose, they end up going into the city...

{% bubble Rinne %}
Alright, Niki, choose your fate. There’s no take-backs, so will you live or die?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Ummmm…left, I think…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Oh really? You sure that’s what you wanna do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Augh, but…! I think it could be right too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
That’s a nice look you’ve got. Don’t think too hard about it or you’ll start losing hair!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
It’s just a game of Old Maid, Rinne-han. You’re being <i>so</i> dramatic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Not only that, but you’re competing for last place.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Shaddup. There’s a whole world of a difference between last and anything else!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
…I’ll go for this one! Hiyaaah!

Uwah?! I pulled the Joker again! After I finally got Rinne-kun to take it from me too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Gyahaha! That Old Maid loves you so much it’s making me jealous, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
<i>Suuure</i> she is. Haa…I’m right back to where I started. Unlucky.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Ehehe~ As long as the Old Maid doesn’t come back to me, it’ll be a happy ending.

Isn’t about time you’ve faced what was coming to you, Niki? Hand over that wallet juuuust like promised~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I don’t remember ever making a promise like that! I’m never handing over my wallet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
…Hm? Who’s that tapping on my shoulder? Kohaku-chan?

I’m no grandpappy, so there’s no need to give me a backru–

Woah there, hold it. I looked away for two seconds and suddenly you got cuter than before. You kinda look like Anzu-chan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Dumbass. That’s because it’s <i>actually</i> Anzu-han, not me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
I knew that. I’m joking, I’m joking!

What’s up, Anzu-chan? Wanna play with me a bit?

Alright, be my guest! Let’s take down Niki together!

…You’re here to talk about work, you say? You want to start working on my “personalized outfit”?

Hell yeah! Make it the perfect fit for me, pretty please~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Huh, so Rinne-kun is next…did you need input from us too?

Mhmm. So you wanna know more about Rinne-kun so that you can get an idea of what kind of outfit would fit him…
{% endbubble %}

![merumeru](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710007974/enstars/dialogue/rinne%20fs1/ch1/epblozoklodnvsii9gia.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–When it came to HiMERU’s “personalized outfit”, you had to sneak around for an idea, so you thought it’d be better to ask directly this time. How productive of you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
If we could describe Rinne-han in one word what would it be, huh…

Good-for-nothing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Scum.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Leader.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Did you say “Leader”? HiMERU-kun, you must respect Rinne-kun a lot, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU is just stating the facts. It’s not a matter of his opinion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Going that far?! Rinne-kun’ll get all choked up y’know…

Anzu-chan, you took notes of all that so fast, but that’s not gonna do you any good now, is it? I don’t think I want my “personalized outfit” to be based on the idea that I’m good-for-nothing scum!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Koh koh koh. Well, when you think of a leader that just so happens to be good-for-nothing scum, there’s a certain troublemaker that comes to mind.
{% endbubble %}

![nyaha](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710007977/enstars/dialogue/rinne%20fs1/ch1/ksrbdjmagqpqwfa6prmd.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
I know, right~ If you turn that idea into an actual product, then you’ll <i>really</i> end up with a costume only Rinne-kun could wear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Niki, you asshole, you’re going <i>way</i> overboard! When Anzu-chan asks about <i>your</i> “personalized outfit” I’ll tell her to make something weird and see how <i>you</i> like it!

Anzu-chan, how about you make him wear all kinds of cooking appliances? Something like a knife or grater, hmmm~?

Hm? You’re more focused on my “personalized outfit” right now?

What do I wanna wear? I already said I wanted something that fits me perfectly, right?

Ohoho~ You don’t know too much about me yet, so you don’t know what would fit and what wouldn’t? Hmm…

 …I didn’t know you were <i>that</i> into me. Staring at me intensely like that is making me blush~

Since you’re so interested, why don’t we just get married? That way, you can fall for my charms all the time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Idols shouldn’t speak of marriage so carelessly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Thaaat’s right. Anzu-neesan probably isn’t staring at you because she likes you anyways, Rinne-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Besides, you’d be skipping over loads of things by getting married right away. There’s a slow process to that, y’know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
A process, huh…well, if it’s too early to get married, then we <i>could</i> just start out as friends.

Alright then, let’s go on a date. The best way you can get to know someone is by going on a date, after all~
{% endbubble %}

![spot](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710007978/enstars/dialogue/rinne%20fs1/ch1/qzkyj7vgjenc2w2wuvcx.png)

{% bubble Rinne %}
Here’s a pretty good date spot~ Looks like there’s a bunch of couples everywhere.

From some outside perspective, we’d make the perfect couple, wouldn’t we? Gyahaha~!

…What’s wrong, Anzu-chan? You can’t date idols, huh?

Then just think of it as part of your job, <i>”Producer”</i>. Investigative research for a “personalized outfit”.

…Alright, wanna make a bet?

The rules are pretty simple. No talking about work on our date. First to break that rule is the loser. If you win, Anzu-chan, then I’ll give you a hand with working on my “personalized outfit”.

…What happens if you lose? Don’t you know you can’t win a game if you’re thinking about losing?

Just think about how you want to win and go from there. Alright?

Now, let the game begin. Try your hardest to beat me, Anzu-chan~
