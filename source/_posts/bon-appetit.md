{% bubble Hiiro %}
  I ordered the lightly vanilla scented "pudding a-la-mode"!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  And I got a parfait filled to the brim with seasonal fruit!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  I got this super fancy fruit waffle, and it even comes with a little parfait on the side!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  All three treats in a row make for a pretty *sweet* sight~ All these sweets loom scrumptious! 
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Just like the name of the place, “Fruit Parlor”, says, theres a variety of different fruits on everything on the menu.
  
  I’m unfamiliar with what a “parlor” is, but after following Shiina-san I was able to discover beautiful food. I’m so happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  When I go out to eat so that I can come up with new recipes, I usually go out alone. But I’m glad I let you both tag along~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  Ahaha. When I heard you were coming to the Fruit Parlor, I couldn’t resist since I’ve got a sweet tooth.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Umu. Likewise, I heard it was a good place with splendid food…there’s still so much in the city I don’t know about.
{% endbubble %}

EDITED IMG

{% bubble Niki %}
  …Oop. I’m gonna dig in now. Thank you for the meaaaal~!
{% endbubble %}

> ***Hinata + Hiiro:*** Thank you for the meal!


{% bubble Niki %}
  Just so you know, a "parlor" is a Western-type restaurant that offers a bunch of casual foods and drinks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Heeeh, I've learned something new. Thank you, Shiina-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  Oh right, if you're gonna need a reference for a recipe, do you wanna bite? Cuz this parfait is taaaasty~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  Is it really okay?! I'd love to!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Please try some of my pudding as well. It's delicious, so much so that I can't think of any other way to describe it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  Uuu, you two are too kind! When I finish this recipe I'll *absolutely* let you try it...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Fufu, I'm looking forward to it. Shiina-san always makes such delicious food.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  Soooo true~ Shiina-senpai we're lucky to be in the same room as you. Ah, that reminds me--
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  ? Why did you just point your phone at me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  Oh don't mind me! While you're eating so happily like that, just turn this way a bit please!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  Like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  Ohh, I got a pretty good shot~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  What's with this all of a sudden? Are you posting it to SNS<sup>[1]</sup>?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  ...Not exactly, I actually overheard something back at the agency. Shiina-senpai's turn for a "Feature Live" is coming up.
{% endbubble %}

Image

{% bubble Niki %}
  Heeeh, my "Feature Live"...
  
  Wait, *what?!* It's my turn already?! But didn't Rinne-kun just have a live performance a few days ago?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  That's true, Nii-san's show was recently. However, is there a specific rule for the order?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  No clue. Anzu-san might be looking at the schedule and deciding that way?
  
  ...But let's just leave that be for a bit. The pamphlet for the "Feature Live" features a bunch of off-shots<sup>[2]</sup> of the idols. I thought having this fun time with Shiina-senpai was the perfect chance for an off-shot picture, so I took one~
  
  Shiina-senpai, if out on your day off from work, that means your "off" now right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  I guess? I mean I'm eating food and being really random but it isn't any different from what I do everyday...so maybe it's fine for an offshoot?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  I *know* right? And here's....another shot~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Then, I'll give it my best to take pictures of Shiina-senpai too. I've improving at using a camera recently~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  Having two cameras being pointed at me feels weird but if it really is my turn then it would be a big help if I had a few pictures. I'd be grateful if you randomly took a few.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  Umu, please leave it to us. Would it be alright to send these to Anzu-san later?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  That's right. Instead of sending them to Shiina-senpai it'd just be faster to send them to Anzu-san first. I'll send them and explain~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  Thanks a bunch, you two~
  
  ...Oh, once you're done taking pictures you should probably get back to eating. You'll miss out~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
  Uwah, the ice cream is gonna melt!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
  That's true, we need to eat it quickly...!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  Even if it's sweets, savor it well you two~
{% endbubble %}

   <p>That Night.</p>
</div>

Image

{% bubble Niki %}
  (Tomorrow's prep, check. Sweeping the restaurant and keeping the kitchen clean, check. That's pretty much it for work today, all that's left is waiting for Nee-san here--)

  --Ah, Nee-san, when did you get here?! Please come in instead of staying by the door!
  
  You didn't want to get in the way so you watched and waited for me to finish work? Nono, Nee-san didn't you contact me beforehand? You could've just talked to me at any point with no problem yknow.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  ...So, um. About my "Feature Live", I know it's my turn for it but what did you want to meet up today for?
  
  Eh? A picture? Oh you're talking about the one the other two took? I'm happy you like them, it's all thanks to Hinata-kun and Otouto-san...

  Is this...what I was hoping for? You're asking what kind of moments do I want to post and which off-shot pictures I think are good? Uummmm, I mean if it's just a picture of good food then I have no problem, but it's gonna be in the pamphlet so I have to be in the pictures right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
  .....

  Sorry, I should stay quiet. It's an "off-shoot" so I was just thinking about my time off...

  ? You're asking if I even *have* time off, what do you mean by that?
  
  ...Of course I do, I spend it prepping food at night like this. I'm at the cafeteria or at "Cinnamon" in the kitchen when I'm not doing idol things too. But, today I used my time off to think up ideas for a new recipe.
  
  Wait, wouldn't that count as a chef's job?
{% endbubble %}

Image

{% bubble Niki %}
  Uuu I'm gonna go crazy. What in the world do I consider as time off?
  
  You're asking if I don't have days off to at least tell you what I do in my spare time?

  J-just wait a moment please. I'll try to figure out how I normally am!
{% endbubble %}

**[1]:** An abbreviation meaning "Social Networking Sites", social media basically
**[2]:** Hinata calls them off-shots in the dialogue box written in ktkn. The idea of it described in other FS2 stories is that the pamphlet needs candid (in the moment) pictures of idols in their free time.
