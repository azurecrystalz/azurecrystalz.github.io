  Now that you all are here, it's time for me to say hi.
  
  Again, thanks for gathering here today everyone....~
  
  Since you guys all went through the trouble of preparing a grand party like this, I hope we'll all be able to have a great time.
  
  I know it's only for a short time, but I'm leaving it to you tonight...~!

{% bubble Kohaku %}
  Anzu-han isn't here. She said here's where we'll meet though...un?
  
  Ah, there you are. It's crowded with people, so I didn't recognize you immediately. Sorry about that.
  
  So, what was it that you wanted to give me?
  
  This stuffed bear? ....Fuun, looks like I can pin it to my clothes.
{% endbubble %}

> ***There is a dialogue choice here***

{% bubble Kohaku%}
If you say so, Anzu-han then I'll say that. But can we wait until we take a look around a bit more?
{% endbubble %}

### Midday
![matcha](https://64.media.tumblr.com/961b950b4a7e4b2b63cc11a5086f98da/549529c56c7a8a89-9b/s2048x3072/eef350f85d1a0241f6a11ecbbd152c5dbe85b94b.pnj)


{% bubble Kohaku %}
  There's matcha and genmaicha<sup>[1]</sup>, and that one there is gyukuro<sup>[2]</sup>.....Uuu~n there are more types than I thought.
  
  Nn? The one tapping me on my shoulder is...oh, it's you Anzu-han.
  
  I wasn't so sure what I should drink. I heard Madara-han was bringing some teacakes, so I thought to pick one until then.
{% endbubble %}

> ***There is a dialogue choice here***

{% bubble Kohaku %}
  Did everyone from "Kaori" make this?
  
  Koh-koh-koh~ So that's why there's so many different teas. They must've put in a lot of effort to prepare it. I'll be sure to thank them later.
{% endbubble %}

### Closing
![thank you](https://64.media.tumblr.com/112972f9692413e267f78b499745e2b6/549529c56c7a8a89-e7/s2048x3072/3c5bd0aa935f1d9f648c8527081116ec61c662a2.pnj)

{% bubble Kohaku%}
  Anzu-han, thank you for your hard work and participation today.
  
  Ah, I guess it's time to go talk to everyone.
  
  I'm a little bummed that the party is over.
{% endbubble %}

> ***Anzu:*** Did you have fun?

{% bubble Kohaku %}
  Of course. I ate plenty of good food, and I was able to talk to Love-han and everyone else....
  
  Rinne-han said he was gonna throw me up in the air, and I had to think of what I was gonna do. Well, it was a moment to remember.

{% bubble Madara %}
  Happy birthday, Kohaku-san! You're a big boy now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
  Whagyah?! Don't pick me up, let go of me! You have no idea what I was like when I was young....!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
  Put him down, Mikejima-senpai. I know you really want to celebrate Oukawa's birthday, but it's not right to do something he doesn't want you to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
  Ah, Adonis-san. I'm glad you're here too, thank you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
  Um, why exactly are you thanking him...actually, thanks. For helping me out that is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
  No, it's nothing to thank me for. If we're celebrating, then we should make each other happy.

{% bubble Kohaku %}
  It's about time to wrap up this party. Lemme say a few things before we break off.
  
  To everyone that came here to celebrate with me today, thank you again....~
  
  It made me happy that everyone came to celebrate me this way, I had fun the entire day.
  
  I know I may not be the best idol out there, but I'm looking forward to continue working with everyone.
