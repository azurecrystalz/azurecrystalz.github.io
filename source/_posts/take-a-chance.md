    WaaaaaaAAAAAAA*AAAAHHH!*
    
    We’re falling, we’re falling, we’re *falling!* Please, hurry up and open the parachute already![^1]
    
    Huh, I can’t understand what you’re saying! I’m done for, this is *seriously* the end!
    
    Uwaaa--Ah, it finally opened! What a scare~ This just took 5 years off my lifespan!

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    Thanks for waiting~ Everyone is here, right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_idlr %}
    Ah, Niki-han. Are you almost done with work?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_idlr2 %}
    Yeah, sorry for running late. It’s been a super hectic day since we launched a new menu. I can finally catch my breath.
    
    Anyway, what was the “big offer” you guys brought up yesterday?
    
    Ever since you mentioned it on HoldHands I’ve been curious about it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_plain %}
    Oh, that. Amagi still hasn’t gotten here yet.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_stare %}
    ? But, isn’t it past our scheduled meeting time?
    
    That’s odd~ I mean it’s Rinne-kun, so I thought he’d be here at Cinnamon playing mahjong already.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_disappoint %}
    Yes. Being the only one late after calling everyone here is a bit self centered…
    
    However, this wouldn’t be the first time that man has caused trouble. We can just sit and chat while Shiina has a break.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    It can’t be helped. I’ve got my food, so I’ll eat while I wait.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_cheer %}
    Today’s meal is a burger bowl. I need to enjoy it’s rich taste quick before Rinne-kun comes along and ruins it~
    
    Ahhhhn~
  {% endbubble %}

    Thanks for the meaaaaal~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_surprise %}
    –Huh *what*?! Rinne-kun?!
    
    Wait, Rinne-kun!? What awful timing! Were you *seriously* just hiding out and waiting so that you could eat my burger?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_sigh %}
    When it comes to your meals you really are on edge, huh? I literally just got here.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cheer %}
    Anyways, now that we’re all here let’s hurry and get started.
    
    Y’all got 30 minutes to get ready~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_idlr %}
    Hah? Just what are you suddenly going on about…
    
    We haven’t got the slightest idea what we’re even getting ready for.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}
    Gyahaha, can’t you just tell by looking at me?

    Cuz I’ve got my luggage bag here full of my hopes and dreams~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_stare %}
    No, I really can’t tell…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_happyleft%}
    Hm~ Maybe it’s still too early in the day for you Kohaku-chan~ Don’t freak out, but the new job offer we’ve got is overseas!

    Anzu-chan showed me a tour job with an unknown destination! Doesn’t that just sound like the perfect job for Crazy:B?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_surprise%}
    *Overseas?!*
  {% endbubble %}

  ![HiMERU](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1107908793259524108/1157775463293407292/IMG_8255.png?ex=6519d5ec&is=6518846c&hm=f12eda055449e4fb327ba27d2398d543ca19cad09304cfec7755acf980b27d5f&=&width=1410&height=652)

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_pensive %}
    …Hm. On such short notice.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neutral %}
    Amagi, do you even have a passport?

    Shiina has gone abroad to gather ingredients, and Oukawa has gone abroad to attend “IFF”[^2]. So, that would leave you being the only one with no experience abroad, Amagi.

    It’s hardly been a day since the offer was extended to us, so your passport couldn’t have been issued on the same day, correct?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_think %}
    You’ve got a point…I’ve only got mine made since I was invited to “IFF”s award ceremony, but I don’t think Rinne-han’s had much experience overseas.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}
    Gyahaha~ You guys are thinking way too hard about this, aren’t you?

    Japan’s got no casinos. I made a passport just in case I needed to go to the land of casinos one day, that’s all~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_sigh %}
    Seriously…?

    So we’re not getting this job for professional reasons, Rinne-kun. It sounds to me like a cheesy dream to go overseas to advance as an idol or something, right~?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_disapprove %}
    Isn’t it the opposite? With Crazy:B’s past track record, it’s good that we’re getting a job offer overseas right? Mind you, we *are* a unit that’s only been around for less than a year.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cheer %}
    Getting a job offer from Japan to go overseas should be a dream job for us!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_ugh %}
    I have no hopes or dreams.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    Well, dreams can’t really make me hungry can they~ I get it. I should probably start packing now, shouldn’t I?
    
    It’s not too busy anymore, so I’ve got no issue telling my boss that I’m taking a leave from work for a bit.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_idlr %}
    Is that really okay, Niki-han?
    
    It’s kinda unfair, since your shift isn’t really over until later in the day. You shouldn’t force yourself to cram everything.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_jor5 %}
    Nyahaha. We’re being pulled into another one of Rinne-kun’s ideas again~ At least that’s what *I* think.
    
    But, but! If we’re going abroad then this is something *completely* different! If all our travel expenses are paid for, then I can just be on the search for more ingredients right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_cheer %}
    It’s super handy if this combines both my hobbies and work *and* it's free!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_nerv_laugh %}
    Ah…right. I guess it *is* kinda motivating when a job is convenient isn’t it?
    
    Well, Niki-han, you’ve always been the type to prefer dangos over flowers[^3]. Even if I brought you a bit of a sweet treat and accidentally hurt ya, you wouldn’t be angry with me…
  {% endbubble %}

  ![haku](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1107908793259524108/1157775463599570944/IMG_8277.png?ex=6519d5ec&is=6518846c&hm=ac0b04eb370f2e769c9d8a942f56c2e5beb22d2f6c58a0b91dae583d891a77cb&=&width=1410&height=652)

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_disapprove %}
    But, I should probably hurry and get my stuff ready.
    
    This is Rinne-han we’re talking about after all. He won’t take no for an answer will he?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neutral %}
    –HiMERU supposes so. Given Crazy:B’s tendency to be explosive, he has no place interfering with our work.
    
    HiMERU would also like to offer some advice to you, Amagi, since your experience with going abroad is limited. Please be sure to bring your passport, outfits, and an ID that can be used abroad.
    
    There’s no telling where we’ll be going, but if we end up somewhere pertaining to idol work then we should be able to obtain anything needed for that locally.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}
    Thank yew, that’s what Crazy:B’s all about~
    
    The dice has been thrown. Let’s all say hi to the Goddess of Fate for our first ever overseas trip~
  {% endbubble %}


  <!-- Translation Notes -->
  [^1]: Niki is talking to a skydiving instructor here I believe
  [^2]: Short for “Idol Film Festival”! This was the festival that took place during the movie “Road to Show”, and it's been referenced in Spring Evenings Respite too!
  [^3]: An idiom basically meaning that something doesn’t have to look good for it to actually be good. It’s a bit of an optimistic expression :D !!
