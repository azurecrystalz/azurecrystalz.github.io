    Huh, I can’t understand what you’re saying! I’m done for, this is *seriously* the end!

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    Thanks for waiting~ Everyone is here, right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_idlr %}
    Ah, Niki-han. Are you almost done with work?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_idlr2 %}
    Yeah, sorry for running late. It’s been a super hectic day since we launched a new menu. I can finally catch my breath.
    
    Anyway, what was the “big offer” you guys brought up yesterday?
    
    Ever since you mentioned it on HoldHands I’ve been curious about it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_plain %}
    Oh, that. Amagi still hasn’t gotten here yet.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_stare %}
    ? But, isn’t it past our scheduled meeting time?
    
    That’s odd~ I mean it’s Rinne-kun, so I thought he’d be here at Cinnamon playing mahjong already.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_disappoint %}
    Yes. Being the only one late after calling everyone here is a bit self centered…
    
    However, this wouldn’t be the first time that man has caused trouble. We can just sit and chat while Shiina has a break.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    It can’t be helped. I’ve got my food, so I’ll eat while I wait.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_cheer %}
    Today’s meal is a burger bowl. I need to enjoy it’s rich taste quick before Rinne-kun comes along and ruins it~
    
    Ahhhhn~
  {% endbubble %}

  ![rinne_itadake](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1709943841/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch1/mlkkyy5lgmpiiefstmh7.jpg)

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}

    Thanks for the meaaaaal~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_surprise %}
    –Huh *what*?! Rinne-kun?!
    
    Wait, Rinne-kun!? What awful timing! Were you *seriously* just hiding out and waiting so that you could eat my burger?!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_sigh %}
    When it comes to your meals you really are on edge, huh? I literally just got here.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cheer %}
    Anyways, now that we’re all here let’s hurry and get started.
    
    Y’all got 30 minutes to get ready~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_idlr %}
    Hah? Just what are you suddenly going on about…
    
    We haven’t got the slightest idea what we’re even getting ready for.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}
    Gyahaha, can’t you just tell by looking at me?

    Cuz I’ve got my luggage bag here full of my hopes and dreams~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_stare %}
    No, I really can’t tell…?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_happyleft%}
    Hm~ Maybe it’s still too early in the day for you Kohaku-chan~ Don’t freak out, but the new job offer we’ve got is overseas!

    Anzu-chan showed me a tour job with an unknown destination! Doesn’t that just sound like the perfect job for Crazy:B?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_surprise%}
    *Overseas?!*
  {% endbubble %}

  ![HiMERU](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1709943841/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch1/qb4vzjrq6o6xmsmdogst.jpg)

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_pensive %}
    …Hm. On such short notice.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neutral %}
    Amagi, do you even have a passport?

    Shiina has gone abroad to gather ingredients, and Oukawa has gone abroad to attend “IFF”<sup>**(2)**</sup>. So, that would leave you being the only one with no experience abroad, Amagi.

    It’s hardly been a day since the offer was extended to us, so your passport couldn’t have been issued on the same day, correct?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_think %}
    You’ve got a point…I’ve only got mine made since I was invited to “IFF”s award ceremony, but I don’t think Rinne-han’s had much experience overseas.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}
    Gyahaha~ You guys are thinking way too hard about this, aren’t you?

    Japan’s got no casinos. I made a passport just in case I needed to go to the land of casinos one day, that’s all~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_sigh %}
    Seriously…?

    So we’re not getting this job for professional reasons, Rinne-kun. It sounds to me like a cheesy dream to go overseas to advance as an idol or something, right~?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_disapprove %}
    Isn’t it the opposite? With Crazy:B’s past track record, it’s good that we’re getting a job offer overseas right? Mind you, we *are* a unit that’s only been around for less than a year.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cheer %}
    Getting a job offer from Japan to go overseas should be a dream job for us!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_ugh %}
    I have no hopes or dreams.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    Well, dreams can’t really make me hungry can they~ I get it. I should probably start packing now, shouldn’t I?
    
    It’s not too busy anymore, so I’ve got no issue telling my boss that I’m taking a leave from work for a bit.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_idlr %}
    Is that really okay, Niki-han?
    
    It’s kinda unfair, since your shift isn’t really over until later in the day. You shouldn’t force yourself to cram everything.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_jor5 %}
    Nyahaha. We’re being pulled into another one of Rinne-kun’s ideas again~ At least that’s what *I* think.
    
    But, but! If we’re going abroad then this is something *completely* different! If all our travel expenses are paid for, then I can just be on the search for more ingredients right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_cheer %}
    It’s super handy if this combines both my hobbies and work *and* it's free!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_nerv_laugh %}
    Ah…right. I guess it *is* kinda motivating when a job is convenient isn’t it?
    
    Well, Niki-han, you’ve always been the type to prefer dangos over flowers<sup>**(3)**</sup>. Even if I brought you a bit of a sweet treat and accidentally hurt ya, you wouldn’t be angry with me…
  {% endbubble %}

  ![haku](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1709943840/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch1/hpvav1j6ubwolxg4x1mf.jpg)

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_disapprove %}
    But, I should probably hurry and get my stuff ready.
    
    This is Rinne-han we’re talking about after all. He won’t take no for an answer will he?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neutral %}
    –HiMERU supposes so. Given Crazy:B’s tendency to be explosive, he has no place interfering with our work.
    
    HiMERU would also like to offer some advice to you, Amagi, since your experience with going abroad is limited. Please be sure to bring your passport, outfits, and an ID that can be used abroad.
    
    There’s no telling where we’ll be going, but if we end up somewhere pertaining to idol work then we should be able to obtain anything needed for that locally.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_ehe %}
    Thank yew, that’s what Crazy:B’s all about~
    
    The dice has been thrown. Let’s all say hi to the Goddess of Fate for our first ever overseas trip~

  <h4>Translation Notes</h4>
  
  (1): Niki is talking to a skydiving instructor here

  (2): Short for “Idol Film Festival”! This was the festival that took place during the movie “Road to Show”, and it's been referenced in Spring Evenings Respite too!

  (3): An idiom basically meaning that something doesn’t have to look good for it to actually be good. It’s a bit of an optimistic expression :D !!

  {% bubble Niki wint_sigh%}
    Augh…hah! Ah, I thought I was a goner!
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble Niki wint_ugh %}
    Back then, I was *totally* an idiot for being tempted by foreign ingredients!
    
    I’m not doing something crazy like this again unless I’m getting super rare ingredients, like ones that only grow on cliffs or something!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_nerv_laugh %}
    Are you…serious…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cheer %}
    Alright, we had a pretty fun skydive~
    
    Now! Let’s all get amped up for “Number Eight”, our overseas job!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_stare %}
    “Number Eight”?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_stare %}
    What a clever name~. Were we called here since “bee” and “eight” are the same?<sup>**(4)**</sup>
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_pensive %}
    Number Eight...HiMERU is familiar with it.
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neutral %}
    Are you perhaps referring to the TV program that was once a hit?
    
    Contestants were given a special die made by the program, and were tasked with reaching the goal with instructions from the die before the timer ran out.
    
    It’s rumored that the show was discontinued due to its reckless nature and lack of contestants. How is it still relevant?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_happyleft %}
    As expected of ya, Merumeru. Unlike a certain *someone* that’s only got food on the brain, *you* actually know about the industry~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_graugh %}
    Wh–? You’re not talking about me, are you?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_evil %}
    Hm~? Paranoid much?
  {% endbubble %}

  ![bee](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1700613627/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch%202/gplkszl48jc5zzv1g9dd.png)
    
  {% bubble Rinne wint_smile %}
    Niki aside, let’s keep talking.
    
    After we participated in “The Minotaur’s Labyrinth” some old producer noticed how well we did and offered Crazy:B a chance to participate.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cocky %}  
    A special episode to bring it back to its prime! We’ve even got a chance to go abroad!
    
    *Buuut*, whatever the die says, goes! We’re in the hands of fate…	~
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble Rinne wint_smug %}
    How’s *that?* It’s just the job for us, dontcha think?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_plain %}
    —Hm. HiMERU understands now.
    
    So, the helicopter staff didn’t descend with us.
    
    In older TV programs, the staff followed the contestants to record; but now handheld video cameras have improved.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_think %}
    There’s a car over there, so that probably means we should get in. It’s parked too obviously for it to mean anything else.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_stare %}
    …Waitwaitwait, what’s up with that? That’s not a foreign car, is it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_stare %}
    By the looks of it, it’s simply an ES branded car.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_disapprove %}
    There *has* to be more than *that*. A convertible, with the wheel on the left-side, would be more suited for something like this!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_nerv_laugh %}
    I won’t lie, that’s a little disappointing. It just doesn’t have that foreign vibe.
  {% endbubble %}

![look](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1700613626/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch%202/tdqcpaol02dksbuf008a.png)

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neutral %}
    Please look. There are multiple cameras supplied in the car. They’re most likely what they want us to use for filming.
    
    There’s also a change of clothes…HiMERU isn’t sure how they retrieved them, but they’re Crazy:B’s practice clothes.
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble HiMERU wint_pensive %}
    Even the die, which is meant to be the program’s symbol, is nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they wanted us to use some of the applications on the tablet they left in the car?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_idlr2 %}
    That could be it. The tablet only has a few apps.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Kohaku wint_neutral %}
    Oh right, we had to leave our phones with the staff back when we were leaving Japan.
    
    In other words, Number Eight won’t let us use any maps.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_plain %}
    In the older versions of the program, the contestants had to travel without the aid of a map. HiMERU supposes this is a more modernized version of that restriction.
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble HiMERU wint_ghk %}
    However, Number Eight was originally a difficult variety show with comedians as the contestants.
    
    The premise of directions written on the die is what was deemed as “reckless”–hopefully, that aspect of the program has been updated to modern compliance standards as well.
  {% endbubble %}

![konbu](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1700613626/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch%202/giqu6xwx2fsj1icuaxav.png)

  {% bubble Niki wint_idlr %}
    Comp–kelp<sup>**(5)**</sup>? Sounds like the name of an all-new spice.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_neut_left %}
    *Compliance.* If the game is too punishing, then the audience will surely be displeased.
    
    But even if it wasn’t a matter of legality, HiMERU would like for them to give us leeway.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne %}
    Thinking that far ahead are ya?
    
    It’s no fun if we spend too much time chit-chatting. Let’s hurry and roll the dice already.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_satisfied %}
    Fine by me. I’m already getting hungry, so I wanna get out of here soon.
    
    Who wants to roll first? If nobody wants to, then I can.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_think %}
    Oh right. It would *suck* if it landed on the wrong side and put you in a bad mood, Niki.
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble Rinne wint_cocky %}
    At that point you just gotta take the blame! So go ahead and take the first shot at it, will ya?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_cheer %}
    Alright. Just leave it to me…~
    
    The first challenge is…here!

  {% bubble HiMERU wint_smile %}
    “Enjoy a lunch abroad”. Hm, it seems Shiina’s wish was granted, and the initial stakes were more forgiving.
    
    Why don’t we drive to a more populated area first?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_cheer %}
    Right on! Leave the wheel to me!
    
    I got an international driver’s license so that I could hit up a casino whenever I want~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_sigh %}
    Your obsession with gambling is insufferable.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_superior %}
    Huu~uh? Did you say something, Niki-kyun?
    
    Surely you don’t want to defy *me*, do you? I’m the only one with a license, y’know. Did you want to take this trip on foot~?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_uso %}
    N-no way! I really *don’t!*
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Niki wint_ugh %}  
    Ugh. If I’d known Rinne-kun would be holding my life in his hands<sup>**(6)**</sup>, then I *never* would’ve agreed to this job…!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Rinne wint_hah %}
    Ahn? Did you say something, Niki?
  {% endbubble %}
    
  {% bubble Rinne wint_cocky %}
    If you’ve got no more complaints left, then let’s go. First stop, “Getting some lunch”!

  <!-- Translation Notes -->

  <h4>Translation Notes</h4>

  (4): Homophone! “Eight” and “bee” in japanese are both pronounced “hachi”! This kind of reference has been hat-tipped a few times in enstars, but one of the most memorable to me is the fact that Crazy:B’s TRIP album campaign ended on 08.08.2023 !!

  (5): Niki here is trying to echo HiMERU saying “compliance”/“konpuraiansu” (written in ktkn), but ended up thinking he meant “kelp”/”konbu”. so in the textbox he’s like “konpu…konbu?”

  (6): 生殺与奪の権を握る - literally meaning “holding power over life and death” but figuratively means “to have full power over a person”. Someone might use this expression to say something like “don’t let others have the power to control your life”, that kinda thing. In context, I think Niki here intends to say that he wouldn’t have accepted if Rinne was gonna control what he did.

{% bubble Niki %}
…….

…Are we there yettttt~? I’m already starving!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Quit your whining. We <i>just</i> got on the road. Don’t start yapping like that to me for another hour or so.

More importantly, how about you two back there? Have you figured out how to put that tablet to good use?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Yes. There appears to be a document stating the outline of the project in one of the applications. Similar to an instructional guide.

Looking at what the document says, this tablet supplied by “Number Eight” has two primary functions.

Firstly, an application to roll a die.

It’s monitored so that once the die has been thrown, it can’t be thrown again until the previous objective has been completed.

The die has twelve sides…a dodecahedron.

It’s also written that by completing the objective at hand, we’ll be rewarded.

The rewards can be anything from a beneficial service, money, or even additional applications to the tablet. However–

It also supplies clues in order to complete the bigger goal.

We have a 24 hour time limit. If we reach the goal point safely within the allotted time frame, we’ll be rewarded with the ability to perform a new song in new outfits live.

{% bubble Niki %}
That reminds me, wasn’t our last reward in “The Minotaur's Labyrinth” a new song too? Do they just think that if they dangle a new song over our heads we’re gonna be desperate to grab it?

I personally want a nice big meal over performing a new song live.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Just think of it as work then, Shiina. By getting paid “L$”, you’ll be able to buy the food you’d like.

Money can’t buy happiness, but it <i>can</i> buy most of the things people want to become happy–that’s the entire premise of capitalism.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
I’ve got a grip on how the rules work now. What about the other function you mentioned?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
It’s a communication function. Though it looks like it’s solely provided for emergency purposes.

For instance, if there is an issue with filming, then we could contact the staff–or they could contact us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Hmm…? Seems like it’s not a half bad plan to keep beloved idols safe. Will they just end up doing a little extra if they don’t have enough shots?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Probably. That was the purpose of “Number Eight” to begin with.

At any rate, those are the functions of the tablet. All that’s left is to take the car and get to the goal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Yup. It would’ve been useful if that thing came with a map or something, but it’s fine.

I spent such a long time back at my hometown in nature that I’ll be able to find our way around without a map or GPS.

We’ll be there in no time~

{% bubble Rinne %}
~♪ ~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
…Rinne-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Hm, what’s up? Gonna shower me with how hungry you are again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
No, I wasn’t planning to.

It’s just that it’s been a while since we’ve last seen anyone. Is that okay? We’re not completely lost are we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
And <i>how</i>, exactly, could I get lost without a map?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
We’re driving through a pretty open expanse of foreign land.

It’s no good if you can’t even put up with it this long, y’know.<sup>(7)</sup>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Agreed. In fact, it would be a <i>good</i> thing if we arrived in an hour.

Pray to Buddha all you’d like, Shiina, but it’d be best to sit a bit longer and be patient given you’re the one with the most experience overseas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
No no <i>no!</i> I’m just about ready to eat grass at this point!

Ah, there’s a bit of tumbleweed over there!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
God, would you <i>quit</i> being so fussy already? What are you, four?

Jeez, even <i>you’re</i> being careless, Niki. Why didn’t you bring emergency food if you knew something like this would end up happening?
{% endbubble %}

![obviously](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710298509/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch3/w259pfo8mfccf4xummfq.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
<i>Obviously</i> I brought some! I just ate it all on the bus and plane rides here!

Rinne-kun, you’re underestimating my appetite. You’ll feel hungry as long as you’re alive~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
I guess we really should’ve seen this coming, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Uwah! Don’t look at me like that, Rinne-kun! Look! Keep your eyes on the road!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
There may be a cloud of uncertainty<sup>(8)</sup> at the moment since we haven’t completed the objective at hand.

However, Shiina may be right.

It seems like not knowing when we’re going to arrive is causing a bit of anxiety.

When we do arrive, it would be in our best interest to buy a map with the voucher we have in the car.
{% endbubble %}

![sichiation](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710298509/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch3/vcxbbytfoho7a8gnzpeq.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah. I’d rather not be in the kind of situation where I can’t use the Internet to know where I’m going.

There’s a bunch of tumbleweeds around here…the kind of tumbleweeds you’d see in western movies. In other words, this is probably America.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
We can’t rule Mexico out either.

Wherever we are, we’re just gonna have to keep following the road. We’re bound to hit some kind of town eventually.

…Look, we’re already starting to see road signs.

Town’s ten kilometers away…looks like we’re finally getting somewhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Yeah, our luck is starting to change for the better!

I can’t wait~! Step on it, Rinne-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
I’m already on it.

Just you wait, my gluttonous fiend, we’ll get that lunch in you soon…~
{% endbubble %}

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(7): A bit relevant to the idea Rinne is trying to express, Americans like to say that “you can drive 3 hours in Europe and be in five different countries, but if you drive in America for 3 hours you will still be in America (the same state no less LOL)”.
(8): This is like “storm clouds are gathering” or like there’s a looming sense of danger or worry.

{% bubble Niki %}
Mogu mogu~ Ah, the coast is clear<sup>(9)</sup>...

Speaking of coasts, the west coast is famous for their chili dogs~ I’m gonna eat a bunch!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
It’s good to see that you’re having your fill.

I had no idea what we ended up on America’s west coast. When I came here for “IFF”, I was on the east coast, so seeing a different environment is pretty interesting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Both coasts are thousands of kilometers apart, it’s definitely unlike the landscape of Japan.

In fact, the distance is so far apart that it’s not possible to travel the distance in a day. We should be glad to have been able to get lunch within an hour.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Yeah. We got a GPS as our reward for clearing the objective, too. It’ll make it a lot easier to find our way around now, right?

Besides that, our biggest problem is the die. Just because our first objective was pretty easy to clear since all we had to do was push through, that doesn’t mean the second one’s gonna be just as simple.

I’ll throw the dice this time. You guys better start begging God for something good…~

Here I go…<i>Click</i>~!

“Snap a photo with a polaroid”...? I didn’t even know those old things were still around nowadays.

Did they leave one for us in the trunk?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Not that I can remember. I checked the trunk once we got here, but didn’t see any signs of one.
{% endbubble %}

![nikikyun](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710442698/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch4/uftyabr3gnyvmb6ccsqg.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
I don’t remember seeing one either. I was looking for food, so I don’t <i>think</i> I saw anything else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Meaning, we could interpret our next objective as “<i>Find someone</i> to snap a photo with a polaroid”.

Luckily, HiMERU can speak a bit of English. Shall we try to ask some of the locals?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I have full faith in my body language! I can try to find something by gesturing too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Yeah. Thanks.

…Buuuut, is this really okay? How “Number Eight” is going?

We’ve been getting pretty mellow objectives ‘til now. It’s a lot different from how “The Minotaur’s Labyrinth” ended up.

There’s not even a hint of the good-ol non-compliant “Number Eight”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah. We’re not being chased by any raging bulls or anything. I guess something crazy won’t happen just because we’re abroad.

We’re talking about the show with rumors that it “got so careless it lost cast members” spread around. If it was gonna be changed to fit modern rules, it’d probably be like this.
{% endbubble %}

![fucker](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710442694/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch4/nz89kmczajpnj3kd0sts.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU, for one, thinks it couldn’t be better.

It’s almost as if they’re giving an easier chance for “Crazy:B” to perform live.

It’s unknown if the remaining objectives will have something akin to how “Number Eight” performed in the past, but if it remains like this then winning will be simple.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Yep! I feel like all the hard work we put in is finally paying off~

Ah, Owner-san. Could I get another “chiridoggu” for “teiku-auto”? Another “oudaa puriizu”~! (Thumbs up)<sup>(10)</sup>

Huh? That’s a hamburger though! I was hungry for a chili dog!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Whatever happened to “having full faith in your body language”?

Well, I guess there’s no point in rushing. Let’s see if there’s somewhere the four of us can stay for a bit. Maybe one of the locals will be kind enough to let a few traveling strangers in~?

I’ll go grab one of the cameras from the car so that we can get some footage as we go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Still, a photograph…

Is it wrong for HiMERU to be a bit concerned that this is coming a little too easily?
{% endbubble %}

![my nerves are also shot](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710442695/enstars/dialogue/number%208/take%20a%20chance/ch4/nfmaevwnaoj0f2rsmzft.png)

{% bubble Niki %}
Nyahaha! I don’t think so! We’ve just been through so much that our nerves are shot!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Hm. It <i>is</i> hard to believe that the TV industry, which in itself is willing to put performers through torture, would leave the continuation of a program to a few idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
<th>*(--Apart from that, if it turns out that nothing happens and there isn’t any footage taken, it would mean a harsh blow to Crazy:B.)*</th>

<th>*(As long as there’s enthusiasm in the project, then anything included will suffice. However, the moment that enthusiasm dissipates, nothing done will ever work.)*</th>

<th>*(It sounds like something from a horror story, but that’s just the fact of the matter.)*</th>

<th>*(Producers, staging crew, and other behind the scenes staff lose their passion to make their project’s exterior look good, and the end result is a loss of enthusiasm.)*</th>

<th>*(It’s something that happens within the entertainment industry all too often.)*</th>

<th>*(...It’s hard to think that “Number Eight” would even be that kind of program, but it’s another risk entirely to just follow along the whims of the production team.)*</th>

<th>*(If it gets to the point where there isn’t enough footage, then Amagi will just stir something up as he always does. It’d be best to keep that in mind.)*</th>

<th>*(Worst comes to pass, we'll be the only ones to fend for ourselves.)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

<h4>Translation Notes</h4>

(9): This is playing on what HiMERU said in the previous chapter! HiMERU said there’s clouds of uncertainty and now Niki’s saying it’s all clear! Also get it, they’re on the west coast, and the coast is clear…get it…haha <///3
(10): Niki’s 10/10 English attempt at saying “Could I get another chilidog for takeout? Another order please~!” then gives the owner a thumbs up.
