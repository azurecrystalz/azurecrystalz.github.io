{% bubble Kohaku %}
Whew…I gave it my best today. Good work, HiMERU-han.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–Yes. Good work to you as well, Oukawa. Now then, shall we begin our return?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Huh? Where’d Niki-han go? I know Rinne-han said he was gonna go off to play mahjong somewhere, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Shiina was forced to keep Amagi company. He’d looked to HiMERU as if he was silently crying for help, but of course HiMERU paid it no mind.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ohhh, so that’s how it is. You made your escape after sacrificing Niki-han, HiMERU-han.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
“Sacrifice” is a strong word. HiMERU simply saw that it was getting late and decided it was about time to leave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Good that you did. We’re underage, so it wouldn’t be too good for us to be walking around so late anyway.

Now that going to school is starting to be something I’m actually thinking about, I probably won’t have to stick with Rinne-han on his nights off anymore.

Well, it’s too late in the day to want to think that far ahead, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Right, but it’s always good to plan and be aware.

As far as you know, Oukawa, anyone with poor intentions could take a casual moment and transform it into a scandal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Yeah. Well, we wouldn’t be the type to get caught in those kinds of predicaments.

Was that actually why you tried to get away from Rinne-han, HiMERU-han?

I heard somewhere that you were planning to go back to school at one point, HiMERU-han. If you get caught out at night and get suspended that wouldn’t be too good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–No. Like HiMERU said, he simply wanted to leave quickly.

Different from your case, Oukawa, HiMERU wasn’t doing anything intentionally because of his schooling plans.
{% endbubble %}

![FUCKING SIGHS](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033253/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/ijoygk7gzrkqpdtpzdj1.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Whether he returns to school or not, HiMERU will continue to live as HiMERU.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That so. Well, I’m sure you might be feeling like it's a little late for you to go to highschool now anyways, HiMERU-han

But…HiMERU-han? As a student attending <i>school?</i> I can’t wrap my head around that at all.

…Hmm? It’s Anzu-han. Good evening. Looks like you're on your way home too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–At this hour it’s unsafe for a woman to be alone. Would you like an accompaniment?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
You say you still have work to do? You’re still gonna work even though it’s this late?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
It would be beneficial for you to take breaks and work at a slower pace.

You’re almost finished, so it’ll be alright? That doesn’t sound like you’d be following HiMERU’s advice.
{% endbubble %}

![workaholic](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033253/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/iiohzegbhsbuse00tsi4.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
So this is what a workaholic is like, huh. Rinne-han could learn a thing or two from that. 

HiMERU-han and I were just talking about school, since back-to-school time is coming up.

You almost forgot HiMERU-han went to school?

Koh koh koh~ So you think so too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–It’s not surprising that Anzu-san would think that, since HiMERU has been away from school for a while.

He has rarely had the chance to visit the academy since he began working more with her.
{% endbubble %}

![hm](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033253/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/cxpqvglylxl3pjzmerhf.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
What’s wrong, Anzu-han? What’re you suddenly mumbling for…?

H-huh? “It might be good to make a brochure of his student life”...? Just what are you on about?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
It sounds like she’s come up with an idea. Were you trying to plan something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
<th>*(But, it’s oddly difficult to discern what she’s planning from what she’s muttering.)*</th>

<th>*(It sounds like…“Both long and short term fans of Crazy:B would be happy with it”--)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Anzu-san, could it be that you’re referring to HiMERU’s “Feature Live”?

HiMERU knew it, he supposed he would be hearing from you about it soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Ohh, so that’s what you were getting at. You were talking about the pamphlet that goes along with the “Feature Live”?

With the way you were mumbling all of a sudden, Anzu-han, I was starting to think you were possessed…
{% endbubble %}

![hhhhnmieds](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1710033251/enstars/dialogue/himeru%20fs2/ch1/ibnxblkexiyo9oxc7mrh.png)

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Fufu. Well, whatever the case may have been, HiMERU thinks it would be a great idea to use off-shots of his school life.

There may not be many more opportunities to promote HiMERU in that light in the future given his activities with Crazy:B.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Rinne-han and Niki-han aren’t students, so there’s <i>no</i> chance for them to be doing work at school unless it's something special.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
–However, HiMERU has only decided to return to school. The formal paperwork has yet to be completed.

So, if you would like to host a photoshoot at Shuutetsu Academy, you may have to wait a while.

Yes. HiMERU will contact you when everything is ready, Anzu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Hehe. You look really excited, Anzu-han. I’m excited to see what pamphlet you two come up with~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU isn’t quite sure what exactly it is you’re imagining, but it’ll prove to be difficult if you expect too much.

HiMERU will always be HiMERU. Regardless of if he’s a student or not, that’s a fact that will never change.
