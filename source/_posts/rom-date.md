    Fufu. In our case, those who live by their idols—die by their idols.
    
    On the contrary, that is no life someone should live. Your precious life will rot away, and you will eventually perish.
    
    I worry about you, HiMERU-san.

    —Shut up.
  {% endbubble %}

    Shall I shut that bullshit-filled mouth of yours up—"Tatsumi-senpai"?

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Aha, haha. Ahahahaha...~!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —No, you aren’t supposed to laugh there.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    A-apologies. I really am not used to any of this.
    
    Ah, you wouldn't say all of these things HiMERU-san, or do any of that, or release any of that murderous intent...~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    .......
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    In addition to that, it made me happy to hear you call me "Tatsumi-senpai" the way you used to in the past.

    I wasn't sure how to cope with all of those different emotions, so in the end I reacted strangely...That wasn't your fault at all, HiMERU-san.

    I'm sorry to have delayed you for this long.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —It's nothing you need to apologize for, since it is also HiMERU's fault this isn't going smoothly.

    As a matter of fact, HiMERU isn't used to this either.
    
    Ever since ES's establishment— or rather, ever since HiMERU joined "Crazy:B"—he feels like he's been made to take on jobs he's never tried previously[^1].

    But this..."work"...is meddlesome.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Is that so? HiMERU-san, you've always been spoken highly of for your solo work in films and dramas but…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Those kinds of things have *scripts.* At least with those there's a "correct" answer to an extent, and you'll have some idea of the habits of big actors if you study their previous performances in them thoroughly.

    But this job has none of that. A scenario was prepared, but it's up to us, as the actors, to decide what exactly we'd like to say and do.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    In all honesty, this field of work is not particularly interesting, so there is no way to even get started in learning about it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Aah, I'm the same way. We really are alike, HiMERU-san~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ......
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    My whole life, I never really had much contact with "games". The concept of romantic love is also unfamiliar to me.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    That wouldn't be the same thing as "God's Love" (Agape)[^2], would it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Those things are completely different. Games that endlessly preach the idea of "God's Love" (Agape) are loathsome.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Agreed...ah, I'm a bit troubled. Our current job is to "act as characters in a dating simulator".

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —Now then. Shall we go over the work's premise from the beginning? At this rate, we'll never get anything done.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    "There Are So Many Idols In Love With Me I Just Don't Know What To Do - Love Battle Stadium", also known as "Ai-Stars", is a dating simulator game made for women.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    By the way, there are a lot of game projects that real idols star in, and there are some that only have their faces modeled.

    For example, there's "Ansta" a fighting game in which special abilities are used based on a battle manga[^3].
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    "Ansta"...fumu, I'm not too familiar with that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Apparently it's popular enough that it will be made into its own anime. HiMERU isn't informed much on the details himself, but groups would get into trouble in the past for creating characters inspired by real life idols without their consent.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Is that so…
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Well, all those characters were based on Yumenosaki idols, so it wasn't really much of an issue for Reimei or HiMERU. And so, of all the plenty idol-inspired games, "Ai-Star" seems to be the most popular now.

    Originally it was a "mobile game" available on smartphones apparently. Then, with the use of "SSVRS" technology it was adapted into an all-new hit VR game. It's like falling in love with a real idol, they say. Even more so because of the fact that ES closely collaborated with the project.

    Each idols’ looks, verbiage, and actions were replicated, so it's popularity is no surprise. Thanks to "Ai-stars", "SSVRS" VR headset sales have gone up, and now a large amount of people are playing the game for themselves at home.

    Fufu. You sure are informed, HiMERU-san. You had to have done a lot of studying beforehand.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    But of course. HiMERU would never risk sullying the reputation HiMERU's name has. So he will do his best and ensure there is not a single part of the job left unfinished.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Wonderful. I, too, don't plan to leave anything unfinished. However, this makes me realize that I still might not be giving it my complete best.
    
    HiMERU-san, I'll learn from your example and keep working even harder.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —"Ai-star"'s premise is to make it so that female producers are able to fall in love with a lot of male idols.
    
    In addition, if you tried hard enough, you could be in a romantic relationship with your favorite idols and even marry them.
    
    Actually, that just seems to be the whole point of the game.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Is that even okay? Wouldn't there be legal and ethical issues?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It's just fiction.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu...I'll agree to disagree. However, I have another question still. This is a game where...a female producer falls in love with a male idol, isn't it?
    
    I don't know much on that myself but...
    
    If it's supposed to be a work where the relationship is between a man and a woman, then why were we—as men—whispering flirtatious words to each other?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Was that your idea of flirting? You suddenly started quoting the Bible.
    
    It was surprising and it messed up the entire conversation.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![assassin](https://64.media.tumblr.com/7ca04869dcfd8aafa9f8bb2ed6c3d8bd/b3c7a6f0aee838a7-3c/s2048x3072/c3de0724d7d06f74d7218b67b6eef54b394920d4.pnj)

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. Apologies. I'm really clueless...
    
    *"The assassin is on the run after defecting from the organization, and the assassin that is hot on his tail! The pursued and the pursuer! What type of forbidden love will sprout between them both?!"*

    ...That was the scenario assigned to us, but I don't get half of it.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    HiMERU can't blame you, Tatsumi. Doesn't that kind of story seem heavy? It looks like you can experience all kinds of scenarios like that in "Ai-star".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Wasn't this a game about falling in love with idols...? Why are there assassins in it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Don't ask HiMERU. Projects like these have always had a tendency to overextend over a period of time. They need to constantly add updates—each of them being more diverse than the one before.

    "Ai-stars" has been around for a long time, and with the amount of things being added to it, it's starting to become confusing.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    It seems like even the producers of it feel the same. I can definitely sympathize with how they feel.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    As an aside, "Ai-stars" is a live-action production and you might not know what that is, Tatsumi. Essentially, it's a game made with the idol's actual voice and appearance, so that's why we're being made to film the materials that are necessary to the games production.

    HiMERU doesn't really get why we have to act our romantic scenarios with each other as men. They said it would be more efficient that way...but he wonders if that's actually the reason.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu, I wouldn't know how it would be efficient, but for us we've gone the opposite direction. We've become inefficient.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    ...Yes. Unfortunately.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Anyways. Now "Ai-stars" is going to feature idols from "Crazy:B" and "ALKALOID". It's going to be regarding a Valentine's Day event they plan to add.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu. Well, being the newbies to this that we all are, we're just happy to be getting more work.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Well at least you all are actually *liked* by ES, unlike us.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Nono, we mustn't lower our guard. It's exactly when everything seems like it's going well that we'll be suddenly knocked off your feet.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    You seem to know a lot about that.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Pardon?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Nothing.
    
    If it were like that, then each "unit" would be photographed on their own—but the higher-ups at "Ai-stars" distributed a bigger request of working in romantic pairs.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![warning](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2eb3c880e352663dddc391beed2d6119/56194fd0f5487762-2e/s1280x1920/85aa444ab1ed2c5db9d672fedf2ace4c8799adb7.jpg)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    They wanted to add an interesting curve to the scenario, so instead of having us all work with our "units", we're going to work with our "unit" counterparts.

    Firstly, "Amagi Rinne and Amagi Hiiro".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Love between brothers......it's taboo, unforgiven even by God himself.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![clear](https://64.media.tumblr.com/defbe5ede9d41ded5be56785ff32e4d1/56194fd0f5487762-23/s1280x1920/209ef96d5566dc463385dd662de2ec2c9a0e27df.jpg)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Next, "Oukawa Kohaku and Shiratori Aira".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    That would be different from romance, since they're both good friends, right?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Then, "Shiina Niki and Ayase Mayoi".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Katakana names![^4]
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Shut up! You don't have to comment after everything said! HiMERU is just trying to organize his thoughts!
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Right. Fufu, pardon me...~
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —And lastly, the issue at hand, "HiMERU and Kazehaya Tatsumi".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu. I wonder if they paired us up because we're both from Reimei.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Their intentions are vague. Judging by the behaviors of the higher-ups, evil desires are to be suspected.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Desires?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It appears as though a part of the audience gets really happy when seeing their favorite men getting along well with each other.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    I, too, get happy when I see people I love getting along well.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That wasn't what HiMERU was getting at.

    Anyway, all of the others besides us have finished quickly and with no issue. It's unfortunate for HiMERU that we seem to be the only ones unfit for this kind of work.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes. It seems that even though I like to act like as a proper senior, this isn't something I can do easily.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    That's not really your fault, Tatsumi. Or actually, it's your fault that you keep behaving erratically, but there's a slightly bigger issue at hand—and that is the filming won't stop unless we produce something that will satisfy the requirements of the higher-ups, or something.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![ng](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b90ea04f94e9b0152793274b6c1fee0f/56194fd0f5487762-60/s2048x3072/b416ea4d61a28bcd5807827565bc2a1c44766bab.pnj)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    No matter how bad the acting is, if the producers like it, then it's OK, and if they don't, then it gets an NG[^5].
    
    An example, our Shiina and your Ayase were terrible. A starving Shiina chased a sobbing Ayase around, and a scenario like *that* earned "That's exactly the shot I was looking for!" and they got an OK from the first take.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. Aira-san and his friend[^6] just idly sat and had a friendly chat about sweets, and that immediately earned them the OK. So, why aren't *we* getting it?
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Maybe we should predict what the producer is looking for and change our approach accordingly, but we have no way of knowing what makes a take get an OK or an NG.
  {% endbubble %}

  ![warning](https://64.media.tumblr.com/2eb3c880e352663dddc391beed2d6119/56194fd0f5487762-2e/s1280x1920/85aa444ab1ed2c5db9d672fedf2ace4c8799adb7.jpg)

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    It's certainly confusing. When it came to the Amagi brothers, our Amagi tried to act like he was seducing your Amagi at first—they didn't get the OK to that, since apparently it wasn't what the producer would have liked.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Yes, they were also struggling. Since the other two pairs were able to leave early, all that was left was us and them for a while.

    I tried to motivate Hiiro-san by saying something like "Let's see who can leave here first".
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Their relationship is close. But, while they were chatting on a break, the younger of the two, who was getting really tired from work he was unfamiliar with, moved closer to the older and turned to look at him...and called out "Ni-saaan~".

    The second he looked like he wanted to be spoiled, they immediately received the OK. It seems like that kind of thing was what the producers were looking for.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fufu. The older brother got surprised and then all flustered. I wonder if that kind of odd scenario is what the producers want.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    I wish they'd just say something if that was the case. I still don't know what the producer wants.
    
    I guess that everything kind of *is* supposed to be spontaneous and surprising, but I still haven't been able to get used to your aggressive tone from before, HiMERU-san.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    .........
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    We really still can't seem to get the OK. I wonder what's wrong? Perhaps, should I try to talk more like <ho>Koga-san[^7]?</ho>
  {% endbubble %}

  ![repent](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5332638f410275e74576fb8310775211/56194fd0f5487762-fa/s2048x3072/dddc89f498964cb0587a4c09fb6c9c55d10f9ecb.pnj)

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    "Repent, lowly heathens!"
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    —It seems as though just being spontaneous isn't enough.
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble Tatsumi %}
    Fumu. I really wish there was a way to simply ask the producer what it is they'd like.

    For whatever strange reason, every time we tried to get close to them, they'd run away while shouting "If I look at handsome men for too long my eyes will melt!"
  {% endbubble %}

  {% bubble HiMERU %}
    Just what was that even about...just why is such an eccentric person even in a position of power? It just shows how good at game production they must be.

    It's unfortunate, but we'll just need to keep shooting our shots in the dark—if this keeps up, then we'll never get this done.

<!-- Translation Notes -->

  [^1]: For people unfamiliar with Crazy:B’s need to get work: getting jobs is important to them as it helps them survive as a unit. Because of the incidents during MDM (mainstory), they had a negative image. Finding jobs is hard for them but it’s the only way for them to get a better reputation in order for them to continue being idols (which of course is extremely valuable to each of them in their own way).
  [^2]: Yes “God’s Love” (Agape) is written exactly like this in the dialogue box even in HiMERU’s dialogue. According to Google, Agape is the term that defines God’s immeasurable, incomparable love for humankind. The more you know (I am not religious in the slightest).
  [^3]: Did you know Ensemble Stars was supposed to be a supernatural game before it was made into an idol game? I’ll see if I can find more info in it but I remember seeing lots of talk about it before.
  [^4]: Referring to the fact that “Niki” and “Mayoi” are both written in katakana.
  [^5]: “NG” is an abbreviation for “no good” used typically in casual business talk.
  [^6]: Idk why Tatsumi didn’t just refer to Kohaku here but the line literally says “Aira-san and the other” but it felt too stiff so I used friend to lessen confusion
  [^7]: For those unaware, Koga and Tatsumi are roommates!
