{% bubble Niki %}
Aah…things went great last month~

We gathered around the campfire and ate a bunch of meat! I’m actually really glad that I joined the “Overnight Outdoors Party” group.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I had a blast setting up the tent! Last year, Ra*bits and I were able to set up a campsite on campus with Ado-chan-senpai’s help.

But this year I was the one helping people out! I’ve really become someone other people can count on, ehe~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Yeah, Tenma-kun, you were really a big help. I wasn’t really sure what I should do besides cook, so your help was really appreciated.

I wonder where we’re camping next~? I’m fine with anywhere as long as I can eat a filling meal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I really wanna go overseas! If it’s part of a circle activity, then we’ll get a grant right? That means we’ll get a special kind of money that’ll give us a freebie trip!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nyahaha…it’s a bit tough to apply to go overseas though~ You go to apply, and suddenly they’ll turn down your application in a heartbeat.

If you’re really adamant on going, why not take a personal vacation? If you decide to go during an unpopular season, then you might be able to save money on a ticket.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ehh, but it’ll be boring if I go alone. I wanna go with someone~...

…Ah, it’s Leo-chan-senpai and Anzu-nee-chan!

Leo-chan-senpai, take me with you to Florence!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Leo %}
Alright, alright! I’ll take you, but only if I can put you in my luggage.

My suitcase is super small so you’d have to be tiny enough to fit, ‘kay? Wahaha~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Uu, I’m not giving up on this! Anzu-nee-chan, help me shrink!

Nee-chan is a really good Producer, so I think you can manage it~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Tenma-kun, you’re being too reckless! Nee-san is worried about something.

 …Nn, what’s that? “Personalized outfit”?

You’re wondering what happened to the idea I had for it a week ago?

Uwah, I am *so* sorry. I was so busy trying to whip up a new recipe that I completely forgot about it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Leo %}
Oioi, what’s with this “personalized outfit” thing everyone is making a fuss about~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Oh yeah! I was *really* excited to hear about it!

Poor Anzu-nee-chan, you must’ve been waiting for a while!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
I’m sorry. Uu, I probably caused a lot of trouble for you.

I’ll think of something right now! Ummmmm…

I can’t come up with anything. I really don’t care about fashion. I even ask store clerks to help me with my casual clothes~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
 …Oh! What about an edible outfit? I remember reading an article online that said something about clothes made of chocolate!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
There’s such thing as that?! I *looove* chocolate! I wanna wear that too!

Ooh. Nee-chan is looking it up on her phone and really thinking about it!

You got this, Anzu-nee-chan, you got this! I’ll be cheering you on~!

Eh? You think it’s not impossible to do, but you’re afraid the lighting is gonna melt it?

Oh. I think Nee-chan is right about that. If you try to dash on a stage covered in chocolate, you’ll slip and fall.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Uun…but I really liked that idea…

Ah, Anzu-neesan. Are you free right now? Would you like to go somewhere?

Rinne-kun mentioned that you two came up with the idea for his “personalized outfit” while you were out, is that right?

I can’t come up with anything sitting here, so I want to try thinking while I’m out with you, Nee-san~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Leo %}
Sorry, no can do! She’s supposed to be at a PV meeting with Knights right now. Right, Anzu?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Ah, really? It can’t be helped then, sorry about that.

 …You’re free later in the evening, so it’s fine then?

Uwah! Thank you so much, Nee-san!

Come to the cafeteria after you’re all done. I’ll be waiting for you until then~

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Are you eating dinner, Shiina?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Oh! Hi there, HiMERU-kun, Kohaku-chan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
That’s not usually the serving you usually get, is it, Niki-han? It won’t be enough will it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nyaha. I actually plan on eating dinner later, this is just a light snack~

I have plans to go out, so I need to be ready to go at any time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Plans? …Ah, Anzu-han.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Have you finished everything you needed to? Good work today~

 …You want me to take my time eating? Don’t worry about that, give me just a second~

Mogumogu…gokkun! Thank you for the food~! / Well, we’ll be off now. See you tomorrow, you two~!

Nee-san, where are we headed? I’ll be with you all night~!
{% endbubble %}

![um](https://res.cloudinary.com/djq41tb84/image/upload/v1708218092/enstars/dialogue/niki%20fs/fs1/ggmjfflcowfsi72mefoh.png)

{% bubble Kohaku %}
…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Is it just me, or did he just say “I’ll be with you all night”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
No, HiMERU heard that too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
Great. Glad I’m not hearing things~

Wait, this is no time to feel relieved! Wha?! Are those two a thing now or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
HiMERU isn’t sure. There haven’t been any signs of that.

We may be in the same unit, but that doesn’t mean we know everything about each other. Strange, isn’t it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kohaku %}
You’re telling me! But this is <i>Niki-han</i> we’re talking about!

I feel like I just saw something impossible. I wonder if Rinne-han knows anything about this…?
