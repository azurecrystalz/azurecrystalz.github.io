    Hm. I’m not so sure I know what you’re talking about.

    Buuut, if you’re trying to say that I was injured because of you…then you *should* be able to accept me treating you, no?

  {% bubble Momiji %}
    …I guess so. I’ll be in your care then.

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
    Good girl, cicám.

   Thank you for waiting. Enjoy.

  {% bubble Momiji %}
    Thank you…oh, this is really good！

    Isn’t it? Tokay[^4] wine has a smooth flavor and it’s quite easy to drink.

    This bar certainly doesn’t disappoint when it comes to Hungarian wine.

    You were looking for hidden gem spots in HAMA today, no?

    I’ve tried to share a few places myself…but I find this particular bar to be my favorite.

    You can show it off all you’d like, but let’s keep the wine as our little secret, alright?

  {% bubble Momiji %}
    G-got it.

  {% bubble Kuguri %}
    Mhm, delicious. Tonight’s drink seems especially exquisite.
